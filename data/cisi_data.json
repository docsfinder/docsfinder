        "content": "The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad."

        "author": "Slater, M.",
        "content": "This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways."

        "content": "The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings."

The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision."

        "author": "Brophy, P.",
        "content": "Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the \"real thing\" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology."

        "content": "Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors."

        "content": "As important for staff members' individual development as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most significant attitude one acquired while working for Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in his admonition that, though we were primarily a research library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for \"general\" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection, \"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.\"  This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us."

The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire. Findings of the documentary analysis included the following: Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed. Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization. Definitions of \"browsing\" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research."

About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language."

At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972, LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the 'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19 September 1973."

The college library exists, not merely to house and circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching process with reference service, to afford faculty members library opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a service activity, a tool through which library functions are more fully and efficiently realized. The present work retains most of the material of the first edition, but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in some cases extended."

Beyond this, considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users, a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification.

        "content": "There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."

The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's \"Language as choice and Chance\", 1956, has now taken definite shape. Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book, \"Language as Choice and Chance\", the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample."

But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era, and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding of the American Library Association."

He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate. In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject."

It is simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of Association policy that the profession will support and make effective. A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession.  It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries.  They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call \"professional.\""

        "content": "As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936. During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra."

        "content": "Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity."

The various obscurities involved are indicated by critical questions, which those who write of information need are invited to answer."

In addition there are some suggested measures of effectiveness of the library. A unique outcome of the survey has been the construction and verification of a mathematical model employing probability theory to measure rate and kind of use of library material together with length of stay of library patrons. Such models, characteristic of an operations research approach, give promise of furthering the goal of effective library management and planning."

An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity- judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences..

Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of use by another.."

Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the cited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation requires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve the use of subject terminology..

Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles..

Its advantages are: (1) it provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a \"weak ordering\"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching; and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the requester.."

As an application of this principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents are examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a search over the remainder of the file.."

This is departure from most systems, which attempt to predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system.."

        "content": "The paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching the periodical eye research literature.. Questions were collected from eye researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources.. MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than other non-ophthalmologist searchers.."

This paper considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is the ISRS component..

This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred (\"answer-providing documents\").. \"Answer can be inferred from document\" has many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an \"inference specification\").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a question.. However, because the indexing is \"nonrelational\", it could cause false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately.."

The effect of word frequency and other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be found from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus, however, offers better performance than statistical association methods.."

To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected.. It is concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived, measurements of inter-indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to indexing quality.."

In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness)..

By the use of this model and the definition of a \"true\" science, the goals and requirements for a curriculum in information science are thus established..

Ordering of author' names as an adaptive device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates' contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to their other research.."

        "content": "The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science.  All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries."

In classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless. The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries. Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid \"service.\" Libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques."

Our collaboration was motivated by our shared interest in social stratification, our common concern with advancing scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and the conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications and viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubt that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to a considerable degree.

This form of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privately supported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broader concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing another country with any kind of goods, whether financial, commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and extends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may be defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques, is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition as an important industrial and trade power.  Government use of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.  This integration soon expanded under the new cultural relations program which the United States implemented during World War II to offset the Nazi propaganda and cultural offensive in Latin America."

For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomena and mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure. One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information. The scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the publics so studied."

        "author": "Marquis, D.G. Allen, T.J.",
        "content": "The preceding papers have addressed themselves to the study of information flow in a particular stream of human activity which has been variously called science, pure science, basic research, or fundamental research, and which is only secondarily, if at all, concerned with the practical utilization of its products. At this point it is appropriate to note that there is a parallel activity which includes applied research, exploratory development, and engineering development. This second stream of research we will call technology. Far more is known about the flow of information among scientists than among technologists.  From the knowledge that is available, however, we are led to conclude that the communication patterns in the two areas of activity are not only largely independent of one another, but qualitatively different in their nature.  This difference is reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by which information is diffused within the two sets of practitioners.  The present paper is addressed to these differences and to a discussion of the nature of the communication process between science and technology."

        "author": "Xhignesse, L.V. Osgood, C.E.",
        "content": "The aforementioned studies are related to the problem of information exchange in psychology. Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific communication as well as storage elements for the summary accounts of research undertakings. Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of information flow created by scientists in their work.  The potential usefulness of this type of investigation is increased when it becomes possible to examine the trends through time of the communication network under consideration, and also when different communication networks can be compared. The present paper deals with some of the characteristics of bibliographical citations in the same 21 psychological journals published both in 1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the American Psychological Association and 13 journals published by other organizations."

The correlation between color and illiteracy for persons in the United States, shown later in Table 1, is an individual correlation, because the kind of thing described is an indivisible unit, a person.  In an individual correlation the variables are descriptive properties of individuals, such as height, income, eye color, or race, and not descriptive statistical constants such as rates or means. In an ecological correlation the statistical object is a group of persons.  The correlation between the percentage of the population which is Negro and the percentage of the population which is illiterate for the 48 states, shown later as Figure 2, is an ecological correlation.  The thing described is the population of a state, and not a single individual.  The variables are percentages, descriptive properties of groups, and not descriptive properties of individuals."

When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history - as they well might, for this clan of historians promises to go on forever - they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists (and historians) of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.  They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival.  They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled."

Therefore, the new idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a new field; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, this occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of the human mind into an experimental science.."

Although these two variables are highly correlated, some physicists produce many papers of little significance and other produce a few papers of great significance.. The responses of the community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were investigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting recognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academic departments, and being widely known to one's colleagues.. The reward system operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive, to divert the energies of less creative physicists into other channels, and to produce a higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments than in the weaker departments.."

Interviews with 41 of 55 laureates and comparison of their research output with the output of the matched sample indicate that these patterns hold at every stage of the life-work-cycle.. As laureates report and as their publications collaborate, they exercise noblesse oblige in arranging co-authorship in collaborative publications.. Receipt of the Nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work practices, as a result of changed role obligations and activities.. Reductions in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already eminent..

Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires mailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of a scientists' work are studied.. Four strong determinates of visibility were found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which the scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see.. This latter characteristic is called \"awareness\"..The data indicate that awareness is high in all sectors of the population studied.. Variables such as age, rank of department, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness.. We conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently.."

Using the mail questionnaire, sociometric data on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists, all of whom had published in a particular problem area.. Respondents chose scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists within the area.. Analysis of direct and indirect ties, using Cleman's method for analysis of sociometric connectedness, revealed that a tie with one or more of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less productivity into a large network of influence and communication..

The effect of growth of the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines.."

In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields.. Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines.."

Because of feedback through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity, resources and esteem increases as career age increases.."

Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network structures.."

        "content": "The Problem of assessing the \"quality\" of scientific publications has long been a major impediment to progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963; Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large numbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index (SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool to measure the significance of individual scientists' contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large number of journals.  The number of citations an individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator of the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of that individual's publications."

Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that \"the medium is the message,\" we must concern ourselves with not only the means of document dissemination, but also the content and value of the documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout most of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should think of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data, evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling their transmission to a target: the reader."

        "content": "In spite of concerns expressed in the literature about the health and vigor of the field of information science and of its service-oriented institutions - libraries and information centers - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for optimism.  Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems. This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities. In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information.  This coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science."

        "content": "The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review chapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques."

        "content": "This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled \"Use of Machine- Readable Data Bases.\"  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than a one-year period.  A chapter by Gechman (79) on machine-readable bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971.  A chapter by Housman (100) covered the use of data bases for selective dissemination of information (SDI) and a chapter by Parkins & Kennedy (153) has previously reviewed secondary information services.  This chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier data base papers not treated in prior chapters. For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be an organized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographic or document-related data."

        "author": "Swanson, R.W.",
        "content": "The co-joining of \"design\" with \"evaluation\" that is called for by this chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the author.  In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components.  However, \"design\" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations.  \"Evaluation\" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of \"design\" and \"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products."

        "author": "Schipma, P.B.",
        "content": "This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation. The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation."

This chapter proposes to review the role played by international organizations in stimulating and providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation.  The international organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the second."

        "content": "Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiry has begun to take shape.  This field, which will be referred to as \"Information Science and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use. Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services. The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume, is to provide such a review."

Besides, these matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested in human organization and communication.  While \"user studies\" have not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963 seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For this first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research has witnessed progress along the following lines: Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in this field earlier in less rigorous forms; The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution development records; comparison of research teams working on identical tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before; and An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research in this area."

Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field during the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards and our means of professional communication. The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and grow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of interest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coverage changes.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information Centers, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering automation of technical processes and the other covering document networks, and a new chapter has been added on information system applications in education.  Such applications are important not just because they involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of value to anyone interested in the total communication process. At the same time, \"core\" chapters of the review are continued:  information needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation; and professional aspects of information science. These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their annual literature is significant, large, and growing."

Until the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information needs and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has grown rapidly. There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields. When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating information system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to \"the information problem.\" This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue. Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Science needs them both."

The basic objective - to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review ever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the basic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues to be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify, locate, and examine interesting and important sources of information about various aspects of our technical progress. Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the first time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on the international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also, the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually covered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this year.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better signposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several major segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of the section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some instances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress."

The increasing interest in and movement toward library networks and other cooperative, technology-supported information activities have helped to focus special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology, the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems, but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications. Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first time, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use information-handling systems. Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems and information systems in state and local government.  While the intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of services they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of library and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral areas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the Annual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving techniques they are fostering."

Libraries have assumed the active role of serving the informational, educational and recreational needs of the population.  The size of that population grows constantly, its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of leisure time is increasing. The application of computer technology to libraries, especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in the performance of library functions, is a complex process and demands the highest level of talent of both the library and computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at least a general overview of what library automation is all about."

Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this purpose. The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented. Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only stagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment. Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a country's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and libraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions, develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain."

Questionnaires were sent to all member organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI. Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in 1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source for information as to which centers are processing which data bases. Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and 41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75 that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base processing organizations.  The use of online search services was relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be representative of the 1976 online situation."

For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type."

        "content": "This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information and the end product of the complete research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus. A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent). Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest."

Besides, I hope to be able to convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of users throughout the world."

Citation is only an indicator of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects. Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere. Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/ technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science literature, and this has been reported elsewhere."

The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This results from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearly two hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry' were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary."

In short-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may be solved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to take my housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without considering the possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-term planning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced."

        "content": "For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information systems.  A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R. Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject: such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems. One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting them. In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in this project follows."

Before coming to this, however, it is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which caused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing."

In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today."

The present paper which covers the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop policies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review considers mainly British and American investigations."

        "content": "When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information, very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand, we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable studies.  There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field."

At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In addition to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes (prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and, on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia. All these tapes are searched locally, involving the running of around five hundred profiles weekly."

        "content": "Successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable. By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of an inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher. The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience with the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basis of this system and of its further development."

In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their total productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assess the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concern the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort out what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change, select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of the scientist to this mass of information."

Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836).  His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finite means\" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a \"generative grammar,\" in essentially the contemporary sense of this term. This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions."

Other professional school associations followed:  engineering (1893), law (1900), librarianship (1915), theology (1918), and social work (1919). These associations, to cite a few, have developed in different ways while conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels of influence in affecting professional education."

For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on \"The American Scholar,\" this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor"

In contrast to the bigot of the older style he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others, jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power and authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and political thinkers.

A quick and effective means of acquainting them with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation of relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on the theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake. Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire range of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is concerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact that all but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either as employees or consultants.

For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information retrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the use of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally, in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument; but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this, or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios."

Characteristics measured include size of collection, types of media, staff, budget, services, and sources of support.. Questions are raised concerning the role of the medical library as one institution which participates in the continuing education of the physician.."

Based on cancelled charge slips collected at the Yale Medical Library circulation desk, telephone appointments were made to interview those research investigators whose books has been returned the previous day.. The interviewer obtained answers from the investigator to a questionnaire to discover how the investigator had learned of a book, if the book had been useful, and, if useful, how it had been used.. During the six-month study period, 30.4 percent of researchers' volumes returned were monographs.. Almost four-fifths of books borrowed supplied information wanted, and about four-fifths of books used had been printed in the previous decade.. Nine-tenths of the use of books was research-related, the other tenth being for lecture preparation.."

An analysis in terms of geographic location, type (educational, research, etc.), administrative control, and primary cognate area of these institutions is presented, and their distribution through the various Regional Medical Library areas is noted.. Preliminary estimates are made, based on questionnaire to the libraries, on the size of the library population, their relationship to reporting programs or institutions, exclusive of the hospital population which is being covered in an independent survey.. A questionnaire to library personnel is underway which will establish, along with the other questionnaires, a basis for exploring the relationships which exist between institutions or programs, libraries and manpower.."

Eighty percent (2,431) of the institutions reported that the library used was \"within\" their own institution; 20 percent (608) noted that the library was \"outside\" of their institution.. The distribution of health-related institutions and libraries is shown by RML districts, together with relevant census data.. A classification of libraries, based on the degree of involvement of the libraries' facilities, resources and personnel in supplying services to health-related institutions, was developed..

Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary, job mobility and preference for continuing education programs.. Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were nonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while the remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5 of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force tended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later entry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was calculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male nonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male professionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic mobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility..

The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with great rapidity.."

        "content": "For many years administrators of library collections have sought objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections in the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry. Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined.  These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted equally."

Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation of statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in a variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements. Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes: to demonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universal research use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many local situations the general use of books and journals."

Telephones have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books. Nevertheless, when the term \"machine methods\" is used for libraries today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations."

Probing for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires.. Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow, the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs, since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs.. Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors.. Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..

Realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests are practical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible.. When strict comparability is not important, a library can test itself.. In assessing a reservoir library, test results are supplemented by data on its typical processing time for interlibrary loan requests.. Currently these tests are being used in a national survey..

For the whole sample, citation list in periodical articles were the principal sources of references, although for literature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexing journals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be the most fruitful source of references.. By asking whether the item requested was really useful to their work, a measure of the reliability of the different sources of references was obtained.. Appendixes include the questionnaire, a list of the most frequently borrowed journals, and a list of abstracting and indexing journals used as sources of references.."

Specific examples of how librarians can best serve the information needs of scientists using SDI systems are examined.. It is the basic contention of this paper that the librarian should serve as an intermediary between users and the numerous new information media.. In this manner the librarian can filter and translate the requirements of individual scientists to conform with the inherent limitations of all machine systems while exploiting their capabilities to the fullest.."

        "content": "The breadth and depth of services that ninety-two medical school libraries offer to individual user were ascertained by interviewing the heads of these libraries, employing a standardized inventory procedure developed earlier (Bulletin 56:380-403, Oct.1968).. Selected aspects of the descriptive data obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of services.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services.. One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services relative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single figure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical regions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey data for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most important of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - activities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and recommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate for the Medical Library Association.."

The National Library of Medicine, through the MLAA, has made available $40.8 million to the medical library community under a competitive grant and contract mechanism for the period July 1965 - June 1970.. A total of 604 projects has been executed in resources, research and development, training, construction, regional medical libraries, publications, and special scientific projects.. An assessment is given of each of these programs and their impact on both the National Library of Medicine and individual medical libraries.. In the aggregate, these programs have significantly improved library and information services to the professional health user..

First, there is a relative lack of concern with the rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather than as part of the whole..

        "author": "Orr, Richard H. Schless, Arthur P.",
        "content": "The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin 56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical Library Association.."

        "content": "The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design."

        "content": "In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest."

        "content": "In April 1970, the CAN/SDI project, developed by the Canadian National Science Library, completed its first year of operation.  At that time the project, designed as a national service to alert scientists and technologists to current information in specific fields of research, was serving over six hundred and fifty subscribers requiring a total of more than three thousand five hundred individual computer queries.  Over one thousand personalized bibliographies are prepared each week from commercially available data bases purchased from Chemical Abstracts Service, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and the British Institution of Electrical Engineers.  A detailed description of the service was given in a paper by J.E. Brown published in October 1969."

Neither has information been withheld to force readers tp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, all systems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptive case studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully utilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method rather than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context of a real library environment and against the background of particular institutional service objectives."

Too often, Library administration found it necessary to choose between alternate courses of action without having adequate information. In addition, overburdened department heads rarely found time to alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on the library and their departments, let alone time to make these changes in a systematic manner which considered the impact on other departments and carefully weighed alternative solutions.  As a consequence of this situation, the library administrators were considering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves and the department heads, so that alternate courses of action could be designed and properly evaluated."

Only now and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of the implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly described. It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and description, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or other similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such works, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of what seem to be the most important aspects of each. Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States. Many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging abroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken several books.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If a reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful, that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging. I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in this country will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  In no sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism."

        "content": "This is the final report of the Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC) project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965 by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort to establish a centralized acquisition and processing center.  The report of Phase I-II, completed in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility study, the design of the central system, costs of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a number of related concerns such as accounting, the congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward library services. This report focuses on the experimental operations which were concluded officially on September 30, 1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the theory and principles upon which a system might be based, we are presently concerned with the pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved. Although this report deals primarily with cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe it also contributes to a better understanding of cooperative programs.  The experiment was designed to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/ cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements were made on most internal and external aspects of the system.  Monitoring also extended into the participating libraries where a product acceptance study was conducted.  A secondary objective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participants and the central agency, such as the interface of systems and the human interaction of participants and the Center."

This would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly convenient way of arranging books on shelves.  Some librarians think it is, and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like the Classification Research Group, actually spend years of their time in theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise. Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography) for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians, and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.  In the next field, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding away at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results that impress computer specialists but not information users, who are so deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new."

A few years before, the Classification Research Group had issued a memorandum proclaiming 'the need for a faceted classification as the basis of all methods of information retrieval.'  As part-author of this memorandum, I must now judge the claim to have been too bold, even brash.  But it has been vindicated to an extent, for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis, in the organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search, has been widely accepted - whether these vocabularies are classified or alphabetical, and whether used in pre- or post-coordinate fashion."

To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  The result of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority completed correctly.

Law collections in academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general and special, academic and professional, in these countries."

It was the result of several months' study of library economy as found in some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to various American libraries.  In this study, the author became convinced that the usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional expenditure.  Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him to believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to this increased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other method which he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing and indexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for numbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves."

The classified form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating to it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in the form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  While the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue. Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal influence gained by its being taught to students of library science during the last twenty years. While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for their applicability.  They are all of general application, irrespective of the scheme of classification in use."

But the public, generally, and even many librarians and book-collectors, who should know better, are apparently unaware of the rapid deterioration of the world's libraries under these conditions.  In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive care is regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silver and brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are given no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades the books more than it protects them.  I would judge that more than 90 percent of the books and documents that come to my bindery for repair or restoration are in a condition that could have been avoided by regular and appropriate preventive care.  Unfortunately, even when the custodians of books become aware of the problem, they my be handicapped by the relative unavailability of expert advice on what procedures to follow in conserving their libraries.

When they go through librarians they must develop their questions through four levels of need, referred to here as the visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.. In this pre-search interview with an information-seeker the reference librarian attempts to help him arrive at an understanding od his \"compromised\" need by determining: (1) the subject of his interest; (2) his motivation; (3) his personal characteristics; (4) the relationship of the inquiry to file organization; and (5) anticipated answers.. The author contends that research is needed into the techniques of conducting this negotiation between the user and the reference librarian.."

The statistics can help the librarian decide how to allocate the budget to departments.. Traditional counts, by department personnel or by broad Dewey or LC classes, are imprecise.. An analogy between curriculum and circulation can be constructed by classifying courses in the college catalog (by DC or LC), rearranging the numbers thus generated by department, and then counting circulation within those groups.. The analogy is thus a quantitative measure and a precise reflection of library use according to curriculum.."

The factor analysis sorts out the complex relationships between the twenty-two variables and reduces them to three main factors - two of which seem to describe materials used and users.. The third may describe needs.. The three factors are the chief elements in the formula.. Each factor can be represented by any one or more of the variables in that factor.."

To test this assumption the author hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out of the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments.. In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the second, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting in-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out to in, and the regression equation.."

The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however, will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming, simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian."

Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory. This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" of intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason."

Existing noninferential, formated data systems provide users with tree- structured files or slightly more general network models of the data..

To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process and, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied, we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of the major studies which were conducted for all disciplines. We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order (1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000 scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some of the goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of the communication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it."

Diffusion researchers have long been aware that they were investigating a special type of communication behavior.  In this book we stress communication concepts and frameworks in our analysis of the diffusion process.  We feel this provides an advantage of conceptual clarity as well as ease of wide expression.  Our adoption of the communication viewpoint is reflected in the addition of several chapters, the complete reorganization of all chapters, and the frequent inclusion of new concepts."

Recently, we have reanalyzed our data for the physical, the engineering, and the social sciences.. We do not have time to discuss differences among all three groups, so we have decided to compare only the physical and social sciences.. We have included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs, however, so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups.. Before discussing these differences, we should like to emphasize that there are similarities, that there are of major importance, and that they, in fact, make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible.. We will discuss differences between the physical and the social sciences in terms of three major communication characteristics associated with science.."

Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics. My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic conference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest and most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, but rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity, and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised. I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to solving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear, however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success, whatever solutions ultimately emerge."

Current approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subset of English.. Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language processing systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries - with correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems - may entail a new order of complexity and require the invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and question answering.."

        "author": "Verhoeff, J. Goffman, W. Belzer, J.",
        "content": "In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval systems. First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it.  This situation is, of course, well known. Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory.  However, these should be relatively few.  In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question. So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list.  Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question.  More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set."

        "author": "Quillian, M.R.",
        "content": "The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future."

A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to implementation on storage devices. This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.  The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages."

Of course, if cost is not an object, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are practically limitless.

        "content": "Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science are at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental effects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge. These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific and technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes are not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access. But the changes to be effected also have major social implications; the reasons for publication and use of information are complex, reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods."

Inverted-file retrieval systems using free text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization of storage because of the distribution characteristics.. An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in dictionary look-up times and storage utilization."

For two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major philosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally ignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical models of classification and highly developed classifications of various branches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical problems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of knowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest."

Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey, or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification; organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational methods; and continuing education needs.  The contribution of these library personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However, as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved, there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from the various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences related to the input into and control over the policies of the national structure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issues are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of opinions expressed, these areas are identified."

This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear distinction for the purposes of this work. Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied for library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries, and state library agencies are included in this category. School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of schools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School libraries at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are included. Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which, while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known for their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries, university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as academic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries. Special libraries are those directed toward making information available to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined information needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of nonprofit organizations are common examples. While distinctions between research and special libraries are not always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no serious problems are created."

(2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years. The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate graft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities continue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.

These examples are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, capitalization, transliteration, etc. In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of another country or another language.

Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users' approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for corporate headings present more problems than any other type of heading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as yet paid insufficient attention to these problems."

        "content": "On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems, Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean."

The center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past. For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future. The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general economy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole."

Rather, the approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences.  He must consciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculate their implications for action.

So the book could be read as a philosophy of organization theory, or of architectural or engineering design, or of operations research, or of planning. The word \"inquiry\" suggests that the audience includes persons interested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as the interest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science with respect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and so on.  Inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science.  I could have called the book The Design of Systems, but this would not adequately reflect my style, which is to proceed from the more specific problem of inquiry to the \"whole system.\""

Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most will not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger of destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved. Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well."

Their organization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity for basic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treated in particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific clientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to- follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with established library routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition, physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are included to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures."

Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries, no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American librarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from the past, but we have yet to convert them into history. The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of the literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts. There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the development of American library services which could eventually be put together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship. The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end.  It undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing problems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services in research libraries."

The innovations studied range from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive tribes, and from driver training among public high schools to hybrid corn among farmers.

Today, statistical methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at The City University of New York and at other universities. The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic supplies of data, is not to reinventory the social science data archives that are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate the announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their members.

In the absence of established standards or criteria for measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process; a survey of needs and interests of the target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move. To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities. In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or effectiveness of the program."

What they developed was of a far wider scope than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed and non-printed documents. The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked side by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a common treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension and to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill of all nations. It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men, whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives. And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but added to it fundamental and constructive new elements. Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on documentation available.  But his book gives us before all things an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts."

What specific steps can the library take to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an investment in a security system worthwhile? We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose during our investigation.

The study will attempt to answer two specific questions: 1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to select so-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks and store them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one a university need consider in adopting a storage program; and, if not, how is cost related to the others? The facts and conclusions in this report are based on the library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovations in computer applications and other technologies could presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, but it is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years."

It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology). There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at a very high level indeed."

        "author": "Bourne, C.P.",
        "content": "Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge."

Among these organizations are publishers, computer software and time- sharing companies, micrographic firms, libraries, information centers, and consultants.  The common interest of these diverse organizations is in service based on storage and representation of structured information with output on a recurring or demand basis.  The concept of information as used throughout this book is defined as data organized into a collection of facts and most often recorded in two basic forms: 1) textual data or literature, and 2) numeric data. Roles played by the organizations described on the following pages vary but include one or more of the following functions: data base creation, data base publishing, data transmission, data manipulation and analysis, and data storage and retrieval.  Emphasis in this publication is on organizations involved in computerized services, micrographic applications, selective dissemination of information (SDI), and networking. Not included in the Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services are printed commercial and legal services, traditional academic and special libraries, public information offices, hardware manufacturers and distributors within the computer and micrographic field, conventional indexing and abstracting services, and most library automation programs which are limited to such housekeeping functions as circulation, serials control, and acquisitions."

The primary advantage of citation indexing is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore, citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used in subject indexes."

On this hypothesis, the aggregate of periodicals can be divided into classes according to relevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the more remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce as many references as the more related classes.  The whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of successive generations of diminishing kinship, each generation being greater in number than the preceding, and each constituent of a generation producing inversely according to its degree of remoteness. The investigation covered, in the first place, the references quoted, in the course of four and two and a-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies of Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are prepared in the library.  The source of each reference being given, it was possible to arrange the sources in order of productivity, the results being set down in columns A and B of the table, in the previous column."

Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as dramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digital computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic increase in the volume of data communicated between such machines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either error-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in the terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more economical."

In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself in research on improvement of traditional library systems.  In other instances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still other systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to requests to the active role of supplying documents, or references to them, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of a more descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to in this book as \"document transfer systems,\" implying that the product being retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than the information (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrieval systems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern. The document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing, an abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape."

As new colleges and junior colleges are founded, and established colleges and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs, both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the materials they need are available only in microform.  As a result, the ratio of microforms to books in college and research libraries has been steadily rising."

In some cases there is an elegant, highly academic, and impractical scheme worked out in meticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant.  In a few treasured instances there is a well-considered, realistic, and workmanlike plan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what worked and why."

The much more typical event is one in which the receipt of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two kinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientist as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen again with similar results."

My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the communication system within the individual as related to his physiological, neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society, together with the place of the library in it."

        "content": "The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is appreciated.  For documentation and information retrieval in general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and machine selection are also available.  That classification is of value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is, however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge. It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that this guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade, and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed. These developments have been reported mainly as research papers in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology. There is a need for a more simply written and more readily available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of classification."

Of the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms depressed performance.

        "content": "The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today. The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today. These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results, ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics, but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a factor of major importance."

The fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability."

What can be done about giving informal communication, without destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of the advantages of formal communication, such as, general accessibility, permanence, etc.?

To cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology, considers the special advantages of informal communication, and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments in scientific communication are described; one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to \"informalize\" formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that, in general, attempts to \"formalize\" an informal channel."

Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has gradually been elaborated by our research group. We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics. This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing form of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take the more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their scope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses are commented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present a complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart to the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply tried to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the development of a new alternative."

It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society. These inventions include: The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world.  The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen. The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances. The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent. Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost. On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home. Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other. Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary. Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals. Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a fraction of a second."

They deal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy and discard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit, the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.  The future of friendship and family life in probed.  Strange new subcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array of other subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex."

        "content": "The expansion of government at all levels - international, national, provincial or state, and local - has resulted in increasing government influence on the life of each citizen.  Concomitant with this development is the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports, technical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that no one engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator, researcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person can function without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in few areas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aids been so little systemized. The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well as the trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a direct descendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of published material has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of the two publications; Childs' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately 400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles."

The purpose of this volume is to list reference books basic to research - general and special - and thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for the library assistant, research worker, or other user of library resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and (3) a textbook for the student, who, either in library school, training class, or college course in bibliography, is pursuing a systematic study of reference books. The needs of these types of users have influenced the organization and make-up of this volume, in that the requirements of the first two groups have made the manual more comprehensive than it might have been if intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to sections and many of the annotations have been provided particularly for the library school student."

Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems. From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in this Handbook."

The three chapters following are purely practical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative study.  The last chapter is intended for teachers. The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographical guide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world. It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship students in the course of their project work, on replies to a questionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world, and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over a number of years."

The intent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods available for the application of modern data processing to library operations. For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques into his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary of the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and the technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and, particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining the choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems, as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good management, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to educate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems of applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has already been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out analyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is developing better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a process that is already underway."

        "content": "The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Where one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth. This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different from that of the first. But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first edition."

        "content": "Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to the serious reader today:  those that are content oriented, designed to convey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure, the way in which events are organized.  It is doubtful if an author has any control over which of these two types of books he writes, though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The same applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his unstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmed with data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in their own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awareness of a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatedness leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man must cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this."

The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with learning, and not at all with development or differences related to age. Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is, half a second or less).

They determine also the quality of its successive generations of management. Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility and the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management is:  \"What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about the most effective way to manage people?\"  From the answer to this question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate."

A statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of \"notions\" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.."

Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seek the highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and the greatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict the manager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. This  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to project selection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-product factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve these project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination problems..

Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of information are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need, problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or technique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the opportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative thought proposed by other investigators..

An experiment was conducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company to measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts. The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain types of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape of polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of success forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than several commonly used project status measures.  These results tend to support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models that are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing projects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding."

At the time of the visits, the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically, they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the respective user communities.  Although few people associated with the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbal indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous. Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time and money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate."

Most importantly, this reassessment is based on a unified view of indexing languages (classification schemes) and thesauri as information storage and retrieval systems on the other.  It results in general principles that are applicable to a wide range of situations."

Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us; an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British industry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first impression and summary."

For us the question of whether Hamilton or Madison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods. While we help solve this historical problem, our practical application of Bayes' theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a method being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics.  Furthermore, large practical applications have until now been few, and our work helps fill that gap."

As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of membership, mL(x,y), in L.. Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y).. The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing the role of a name for M(x).. If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is, x = x1 ... xn, xi  T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are deduced from the syntax tree of x..

The purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of what it means to say that a piece of stored information is \"relevant\" to the information need of a retrieval system user.. The suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical implication.. For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with one of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a mathematically precise criterion of relevance.. For other types of fact retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems, including all systems whose stored information is expressed in natural language, the definition is not mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual level.."

Thus, the indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an aid.. An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial set of documents..

The list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each document.. The results of this comparison are encouraging, and they are discussed in the paper.. The economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information retrieval system is considered..

Both attempts only partially succeed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less precise language; for example, in defining \"second order noise,\" she uses the ambiguous phrase \"a formally relevant document which is not really relevant\" - presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of the enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, \"no account is taken of the subjective relevance (pertinence).\"  Yet this is surely the true aim of the system."

The clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results.. Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or other  situations.."

It is true that these exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or postscript to the original papers, the passages added have been italicized."

Because of their somewhat historical slant, these chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book which adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplified concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.

The two projects were rather different as to purpose, method, and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance). Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time, arose partly from his experience in a county library.  His curiousity about the real result of the reference activities (as different from merely counting the questions answered) led him to ask, \"Is there substantial difference between the claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual result as observed in a number of different situations by individuals posing as clients?\"  The study which followed from this question was, then, exploratory and necessarily less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this pair."

The first is the most general that can be proposed for any gathering: the simple advantage of bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least a small class of problems - especially when this problem has not previously benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators. To further such thematic collaboration, the formal presentations have been scheduled no more than three each day, with time left after each presentation for (formal) discussion here in the conference room, and with as much time as possible - given the number of presentations - left free for informal discussion. The second purpose is one of even greater necessity, in my opinion, though one not so obvious as the first.  Over and above the hope for interchange of what has already been thought out - in the form of personal contact, where the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the printed word in its usual and ineffable way - it is my hope that we will all be able (especially in our informal discussions) to penetrate beyond mere similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic relationship."

The relations between concepts often appear to be absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed in the form of groupings called classes."

Serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and with different modes of using term classes are still in progress, so on definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are presented.."

The best-known example of the articulated subject index is that to Chemical Abstracts.. It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more prepositions or connectives.. A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives or words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been developed, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to greatest organization in the index display.. Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval is examined.."

A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision..

Two principles of selection are proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of \"good index terms\", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms.. Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by the experimenter..

Since the user is the only person competent to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval error.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures of performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It is difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in being provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view, therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a deficient system."

With different choice of parameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data bases.. An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to formulation of different search techniques..

The proposal that initiated the Project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems. URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of literature which had been neglected by the information science community before the advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards."

This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development. An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation, file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted information systems may make sense within individual institutional environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores."

In the first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases.. There is every indication that satisfactory back-of-the-book indexes could be produced automatically, with post-editing to delete superfluous items.."

        "author": "Schultz, Claire K.",
        "content": "To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines.."

Also, the computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of internal memory.. The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage.. Creation of \"reduced\" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time.."

In our evaluation, two measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an estimate of the recall ratio.. To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted below.. (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant searching operators.. (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to improving the cost-performance of the system..

The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of fundamental notions such as \"information\" and \"order\".. This gives him a better understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently, even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to make such operations more \"objective\" and formal..

The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference Code when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be built up by a form of \"learning process\" in the course of regular indexing.. The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the associated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language built-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search, using the thesaurus-classification as a \"switching language\", and for automatic classification, are suggested as long-term aims.."

The major results of the theory are quite subtle and abstract and must sometimes be arrived at by what appears to be rather devious routes.  Fortunately, recent simplifications in the theory have made the major results more accessible than in the past."

As might be expected, the special problems presented by serial publications made the task of developing an ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L. Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier. Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen, Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen- space and dubbing the happy couple the \"distinctive title.\""

Reality and knowledge are not represented by words or terms but by the meanings \"behind\" these tokens. A concept of, say, an object, a property of an object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal statements on these as subjects and may therefore be defined as the whole of true and possible predicates that can be collected on a given subject.  It is from these predicates that the characteristics of the corresponding concepts can be derived.  Common characteristics in different concepts lead to relations between concepts, which relations in turn are factors for the formation of concept systems. Different kinds of relationships as well as different kinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointed out that an orderly supply of the elements for propositions (information statements) on new knowledge requires the construction and availability of such concept systems."

How are scientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the circulation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes? Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose.."

In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently they are plagued with serious questions of validity."

Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third of the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loans are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the usefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loan failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted."

        "content": "In 1972-73 approximately 194,000 interlibrary loan requests were not filled because the borrowing library in ignorance requested non-circulating material contrary to the interlibrary lending policies of the lending library.  These unfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lending libraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besides disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials. Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check in advance the lending policies before sending requests. The major elements determining whether or not libraries receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists, especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OF SERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strong collections in a subject field listed in library directories. Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of lending library, the size of collection, budget for current acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers."

Accordingly, our data are presented in those forms and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive statistics: arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories which seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequency of requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested, the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries (university, pharmaceutical, etc.).

The traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social and physical sciences.

Few subjects suffer more than linguistics from the separation of the 'sciences' and the 'humanities' that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools ad universities.  For contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously, and in roughly equal measure, upon the more traditional approach to language that is characteristic of the 'humanities' and the more 'scientific' approach that has developed recently in connection with advances that have been made in formal logic, computer science and automata theory."

All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish bowls. He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower. Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year.

The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or unconstrained..

        "content": "This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact terms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of their relevance to the request.. The key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and arranged in the order of their relevance to the request.."

The documents are then classified into these derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated.. Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or 48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of classification categories and a different computational formula.. The experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification technique.."

Perhaps more importantly, it provides connections between raw, multivariant data and sought-for information without making restrictive assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data. The general problem has been stated as follows.  Given a collection of objects and a list of measurements made on each object, is it possible to find and/or predict a property of the objects that is not directly measurable but is known to be related to the measurements via some unknown relationship?  The only assumption made is that similarities and dissimilarities among objects are reflected in at least some of the measurements."

A threshold level T is applied to the similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that are greater than or equal to the threshold level are set equal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero. Three definitions are applied to the corresponding graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters. These are, (1) the connected components of the graph, (2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and (3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the graph as described that show how insight may be gained into the term relations by varying the threshold levels and the cluster definitions."

        "content": "Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods of the automatic abstracting system is warranted.."

        "content": "This paper defines the relationship between linguistics and information science in terms of a common interest in natural language.  The notion of automated processing of natural language - i.e., machine simulation of the language processing activities of a human - provides novel possibilities for interaction between linguists, who have a theoretical interest in such activities, and information scientists, who have more practical goals, e.g. simulating the language processing activities of an indexer with a machine. The concept of a natural language information system is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated language processing effort by computational linguists and information scientists.  In terms of this framework, the former have concentrated on automating the operations of the component for content analysis and representation, while the latter have emphasized the data management component.  The complementary nature of these developments allows the postulation of an integrated approach to automated language processing.  This approach, which is outlined in the final sections of the paper, incorporates current notions in linguistic theory and information science, as well as design features of recent computational linguistic models."

A thorough discussion of decision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature, outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statistics are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and without document classification information.. Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem, incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation, which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many researchers in this crucial area.."

The level of performance of this program known as \"The Citation Identifier\" is high.. In a recent computer run, The Citation Identifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions of U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227 (that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and three false drops occurred.. Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) were identified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which some citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program (\"short hits\"); and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly included in the citations (\"long hits\"). Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible and can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program.. The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run, the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text was approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increased by suitable changes in the computer program..

General alerting services (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible..

This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made, ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for some typical services.."

The relatively large errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated.. When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept of \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p% library.. It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that are applicable to any other special case.."

        "content": "The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titles for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services, such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information.. The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958.. The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958, and 1968.. Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the KWIC index.."

Some factors influencing the cost-effectiveness of retrieval and dissemination systems are identified.. Various aspects of system operation that are susceptible to cost-effectiveness analysis are discussed, including system coverage, indexing policies and procedures, system vocabulary, searching procedures, and mode of interaction between system and user.. Possible tradeoffs between input and output costs, and the effects of these tradeoffs on cost-effectiveness are presented."

        "content": "Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins' Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher who composed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics with the aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which contained absolutely no information on that subject. The technique used, we are told with a nudge of superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to combine the information. I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific Information is just some special variety of information that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate, pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose too that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be full of scientific books, and that the best possible technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a library qualification and combined it with the appropriate sort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used to say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical compound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there is more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage and retrieval of information, and there is about science and technology something intrinsically different from mere scholarship."

        "content": "ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimental system for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360 through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handle large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations.. At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills of a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained librarians.. Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical of large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper discusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove useful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display format, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability for the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter mnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line numbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of default conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification; and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system.."

        "content": "Interactive systems, in existence for nearly 15 years, are becoming increasingly important, both for information retrieval and library support operations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and - if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost of the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still- high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user- system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the National Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental retrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering the right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls here include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account the social context around the user terminal.. The major national problem is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data bases that will be readily available during the next few years.. We do not need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential of on-line systems, but we do need breakthroughs in organizing for technological change.."

        "content": "A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were examined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measures and a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the main experiment the effect on performance of the following variables was tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes, question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. In addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific.. It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all factors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present.."

        "content": "Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval purposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic experiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions have been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic keyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications should have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword frequency.."

To fulfill this responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicit reliable information concerning courses being offered relating to information storage and retrieval, information science and/or documentation.  The data requested included course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses, textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with which offered, etc. Responses were received from 45 schools, providing information about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Using several methods of clustering the data, it was difficult to arrive at firm results, because of the diversity and scatter of the topics included in this field.  It was therefore decided to hold a workshop of experts which would examine the validity of the questionnaire results. This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arrive at consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburgh on September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in the field representing universities industry and government were brought together to participate.  Consensus was reached in identifying nine factors which contribute to the curriculum in information science and seven courses which constitute the core for the Master's program. The topics to be included in each of these courses were also isolated."

        "content": "Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexing systems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selected for fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval.. Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which include those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes.. The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components, and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form.. These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA) for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent.. It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the application of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinate basis.."

A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds.."

        "content": "This article focuses on the human interaction characteristics of an information retrieval system, suggests some design considerations to improve man-machine cooperation, and describes a research system at Stanford that is exploring some of these techniques.. Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate search query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, the process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the information available in te system, remains one of the principal problems in information retrieval today.. In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem into the structure and vocabulary of the system.."

The results obtained with a collection of documents chosen independently of either SMART or MEDLARS indicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstracts produces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with MEDLARS indexing.. A replacement of the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked output normally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent.. When automatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the SMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained by the intellectual MEDLARS indexing.. Finally, the incorporation of user feedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS output of 15 to 30 percent.. One concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining controlled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments.."

        "author": "Katzer, Jeffrey",
        "content": "A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest.. To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system.. Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the total variance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading.. In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions.. Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD.. The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure and the need for a predicative replication of the study.."

The 300 articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during this four-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate by year serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak during the third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citation were noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author, 15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations..

For this reason, there are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and retrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature (\"one-way\" communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (\"both-way\" communication).. The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts of meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating of a thesaurus.."

Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the observable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem.. Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an integrated approach to problems.."

Important principles of information system design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy for the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users' needs studies by the representative small group technique; the analysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable existent information storage and retrieval system from those available; the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing a model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final design of a cost-effective system..

But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions:\tHow can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in terms of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from the naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it by experimentation.."

        "author": "O'Connor, John",
        "content": "Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasions determined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" are retrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providing or \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntactic joints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well.. The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers.. In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results.. The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" and it is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted.."

There is no evidence for synchronous obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there is some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with greater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order for heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies to densities of use.. It is suggested that, for comparing the relative values of different journals, or age groups, in library use or citation studies, analyses of raw frequencies are valueless, and indeed potentially dangerously misleading, until they are converted to allow for the numbers of available items in each group examined.."

If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed and the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity of the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptual distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The various index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences in their performance are correspondingly great.. The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and retrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a graph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these points represent concept relations..

The best words are those which achieve the greatest separation.. The discrimination value analysis is computationally simple, and it assigns a specific role in content analysis to single words, juxtaposed words and phrases, and word groups or thesaurus categories..

In Part I of the study, a mixture of two Poisson distributions is examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution, and formulas expressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empirical frequency statistics are derived.. The fit of the model is tested on an experimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the purposes of the study.. A measure intended to identify specialty words, consistent with the 2-Poisson model, is proposed and evaluated.."

The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of the data elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well.. Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, was found to be relatively unimportant.."

However, they may remember a surprising amount of such \"nonstandard\" information as the color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this type of \"nonstandard\" information be profitably exploited in computerized catalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth as many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many situations.."

        "author": "Maron, M. E. Kuhns, J. L.",
        "content": "This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and searching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called \"Probabilistic Indexing,\" allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the \"relevance number\") for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance.. The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (\"see\" and \"see also\") is based solely on the \"semantical closeness\" between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.. Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user.."

The former approach has been favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for new methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those of traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been thriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed.. The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support the hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100 keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the range of one through eight words per document.. Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practical problems to be faced are outlined.."

Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for.."

These matters are distinct and must be distinguished.  Then conditions must be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow. In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source, Destination, and Designation. \"Flow\" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common, forming a tetrad.  Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair. Between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow, according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to achieve the flow."

While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence location). The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposed components dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentence selection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words, key words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, research methodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation."

A disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore, that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to generate and how to interpret a chemical code.\tCodes are needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical structures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would relieve the chemist of considerable burden."

This identifying label, referred to as a registry number, is the thread that ties together all information associated with a particular compound throughout the developing CAS computer system.

        "content": "A computer program is described which generates a connectivity matrix using as input an unmodified Wiswesser notation.  This program records the topology of a molecule as a statement of the atoms and their connectivity.  One symbol is used to represent each atom and this symbol is descriptive of the atom and its bonds.  The network of a complex molecule is recorded as a series of interruptions in an assumed linear path.  The application of this matrix to information handling of chemical structures is described in a subsequent paper."

The system is intended to monitor a large scale experiment in file organization for a real-time, interactive chemical information system.  It is based upon a topological screen system that ensures the inclusion of every compound atom (including H) in at least one screen assignment, that appears to be responsive to a broad range of query types, and that is amenable to random- access techniques.  The Monitor system is also considered, in this paper, as an independent interim approach toward fulfilling, in an effective and economic manner, the functional requirements of a small- to medium-sized chemical information system.  Thus it could be used to encode and generate structure files, to assign search screens, and to provide manual substructure search capability via microfilm or hard copy printed indexes."

Over 13,000 compounds per month are provided in machine language.  The canonical WLN is also provided in alphabetized printouts. Encoding of over 400,000 new chemical compounds from IC has already been completed, including all those reported in 1967, 1968, and 1969.  Since the tapes also include title and other bibliographic information, this paper describes the use of supporting software provided for SDI search systems employing \"word\" and other searching terms, in addition to the WLN fragments.

A creative index is achievable if the relationship and association of things and actions, one to another, can be communicated as a continuous function vis-a-vis the real world of science and technology. A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example, ethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merely a word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  It is a concept that he associates with or relates to a product, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, a property, etc.  It is within the semantics of his conceptual needs that he would like to use an index to retrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more than documents, however, from the index.  He wants the index to direct him to those documents which are pertinent to his problem.  He wants the index to help him to generate thoughts and to suggest new combinations. He wants the index to help him in terms of his language, logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific approach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants the ability to browse among the terms to discover the term that is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in his memory.  These are the criteria an index must satisfy if it is to be a creative medium of communication."

The center was designed to provide current awareness and retrospective search services from both document-type and data-type computerized data files.  The desire to develop transferable programs for use at many installations prompted the adoption of the machine-independent compiler language PL/1 and the use of IBM 360 series computers.

The WLN generation programs accept connection table input, either from a previously existing file or generated from the Rand Tablet drawing.  The programs recognize situations which they cannot handle - the output is thus either correct WLN or a message by which the programs acknowledge their limitations.  In general, correct WLN will be produced for any compound containing not more than one nonbenzene ring.  Work is under way to extend this to polycyclic fused ring systems.  The philosophy and concepts behind these programs are explained along with the more interesting algorithmic results.  The role of the WLN-generation programs in a developing NIH chemical information system is briefly discussed. The WLN programs are written in Fortran IV and have been developed on a PDP-10 computer."

A strategy which takes account of the disparate frequencies of the various species of fragments in a data-base by use of differential, and, in part, hierarchical levels of description is detailed.  The distributions of a variety of structural characteristics, including bond-centered, atom-centered, and ring fragments in a 30,000-compound sample of the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry System are summarized.  Implementation of the approach, using primarily bond-centered fragments, by means of simple and highly efficient computer programs, is detailed."

While remaining generally within the framework of IUPAC and other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended names have been chosen.  These names are more easily derived from molecular structural diagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users.  Machine editing of index names and translation of these names into structural representations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aided by the revisions.  The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all \"trivial\" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplification of general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment for certain classes of substances.  Specific identifiable alloys, elementary particles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventional chemical substances.  Difficulties encountered with generation of previous Chemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisons are made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituent radicals."

        "content": "There are many chemical retrieval systems which process the first type of request efficiently.  Most of these systems are also capable of handling certain fragment requests; however, the fragments which can be processed are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are readily detected.  To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures. Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm, some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for a digital computer is discussed. This report is a condensed version of the original, which gives a generalization and comprehensive description of the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics, and applications other than chemical retrieval systems."

The third refinement of this system, Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques for registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each substance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature derivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The general design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic segments, is presented."

The technique is illustrated with part of an index to a recent abstracting journal.  The wide variety of controls which can be exerted by the indexer and the program is discussed."

Little attention has been paid to the behavior of the scientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literature in that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behavior and thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion that the literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  What seems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that the new and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and that the system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selective compression."

User acceptance of this microfilm application has been greatly improved by loading the file into cartridges and making use of motor-driven reader-printers.  This equipment permits rapid searching of the microfilm and adds the convenience of on-the-spot hard-copy prints as needed.  Of prime importance are the economic advantages of these editions, since they allow many special libraries to stretch greatly the space available to them for journal housing.  The economics of this approach are also discussed, as are the reactions of the scientists and information personnel who use them."

An analysis of the information transferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search strategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles are not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used as synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal articles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistry are more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting and other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the underlying information transfer principles."

For purposes of comparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is represented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  The results of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4. The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  About half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers published in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects the present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation and its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another striking fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work published in the journal itself.  In Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations is 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the fact that writers who habitually publish in a particular journal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seems to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these journals in their respective fields.  More than 38% of the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry are to various American Chemical Society publications. In the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than 45% of the citations are to Society publications."

The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee was to survey organizations that generate and/or process large data bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways in which one can view a data base as being large.  It can be large in terms of having a large number of entries or records (or bibliographic references).  It can be large in the sense of having a large number of fields or data elements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can be thought of as large in the sense of having a large number of searchable or selectable elements, and it also can be large in the most readily understandable sense of having a large number of characters in storage."

        "content": "The increasing availability of computer-readable files of chemical nomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the development of methods for performing substructure searches in which CA nomenclature terms are used as search terms.  Substructure searches on CA Index nomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological searches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of searches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also contain nonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance data can often be done within a single search of a file with both high recall and relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possible for persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to construct nomenclature profiles for many questions."

        "author": "Zadeh, L. A.",
        "content": "A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very, more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man.. To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc.. Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it falls into category I or II.. The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly, etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper.."

Other, more complex, entries can be transformed after somewhat deeper analysis.. These manipulations are a necessary preliminary step to the use of the subject-index language in retrieval..A scheme is outlined for automatically compiling and editing subject indexes by transforming descriptive phrases with regular structure and vocabulary.. These transformations, based on the formal structure of language, are shown to be admirably suited to computer manipulation.."

'This 'citation law' is based on the remarkable fact that in more than 150 years the mean number of relevant citations per article per year has remained constant, viz. 2x8, in spite of the fact that after 1950 three times as many articles have been published as in the period before 1950.."

But present formulations of the Bradford distribution demand penetrating search for peripheral papers and tedious computation in application.. The present paper shows that the Bradford distribution is closely related to the Zipf distribution.. It requires data on only the most productive journals, is mathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of the 'completeness' of a search is accepted.. For comparability of results, certain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of journals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested.. It is found, however, that a modified form of the Bradford distribution is required when Bradford-type collections of journals are merged into large collections, when 'saturation' of the most productive journals occurs.."

He used the term to mean the illumination of the processes of science and technology by means of counting documents.  Hulme both summarized the results of Cole and Eales and produced original work on the growth of UK patents (relating these to social progress in the UK) and on the changes displayed in the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature (relating changes in subject and country production of literature to international developments)."

        "content": "It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presented which appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverse relationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly not new; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and ABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not- Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising from Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked. In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, has four qualifications to the basic statement."

The criteria for defining the terminological consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for determining the degree of terminological consistency. The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such as, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances in which terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientific community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines - are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificially created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current developments and thus points to the source of natural language."

From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification.. Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates, and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form.. The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with complete flexibility.."

Bradford listed the journals concerned in order of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced, he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many later workers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of literature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these results Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference scattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted not a straight line but a curve.  Kendall has now provided a more refined statistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford."

The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languages creating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and that, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their difficulties.. The results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which the appropriate authorities might follow..

This paper discusses the variable of 'implicit use orientations' - the particular attitude taken by a subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and forty judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another.. Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgements have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarily obtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation studies.."

The conclusions or their generality may sometimes be invalidated by special conditions in the survey sample, by the environment having been disturbed by the survey, by the interpretation given to questions or observations, or by the way the data has been analyzed.\tThese same factors make direct comparison of results from different surveys difficult, and make superficial comparisons misleading.  Some comparisons and conclusions are certainly much less sound than the casual reader might suppose, particularly when results have been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey.

A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and the results are reported here. Our results are presented below in the following form: 1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references, reports, etc.). 2. Abstracts journals consulted. 3. Coverage and multiple coverage.

When we consider the relationship between operating efficiency and economic efficiency, we are faced with a whole series of possible trade-offs.. There may be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs.. The problem is to determine the most economical path to follow.. Pay-off factors, break-even points, and diminishing returns must be taken into consideration.. This paper considers some of these factors in relation to various parts of the complete retrieval system: the acquisition subsystem, the indexing subsystem, the index language, the searching subsystem, and the equipment subsystem.."

The net increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwise be expected. Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending to have its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off from the classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science. Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on average be adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information) by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main theme, associated concepts and methods, and general background."

This term, resuscitated by Alan Pritchard (see page 348), denotes, in my paraphrase, quantitative treatment of the properties of recorded discourse and behaviour appertaining to it. In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford or Zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical literature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in the cumulative yield from a given input.  The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is, the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.  This type of behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from meteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanations appropriate to the particular fields.  Thus it has received many names according to its exponents, in both senses of that word."

Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than disintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half the active life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during which one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerous studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points out that different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the 'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of literature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accurate measures for discriminating between different subject-fields."

This was a subject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length, advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits, without ever stating a single demonstratable fact.  When, in the early 1950's, various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for indexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments.  In an editorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint, shared by many others, when he wrote: Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems.  May the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems of the future.  There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and costs.  The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid intellectual discipline."

Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevant to a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we think we want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to find more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  This implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.  The fact that the instrument we use to assist this operation may display quasi-classificatory features (e.g., alphabetical sequence) or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory store should not hide this otherwise obvious fact."

In the schedules the term is displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships which cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers.. The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and computerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain traditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines for main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term concepts.. Methods of application of the Thesaurofacet in pre-coordinate and post-coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the techniques employed in its compilation.."

        "content": "This paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by the Library.. It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the non-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has already been installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out the degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library, the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand and not available.. They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for books that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of time, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure from one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the library.. From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library procedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of books failing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library.. The time spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given.."

        "author": "Sparck-Jones, K.",
        "content": "The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.."

The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the four data-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them.. Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used in the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions were constructed for searching against each database, output was assessed for relevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recall ratios) were calculated for each profile.. The overall retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against data-bases containing titles only, titles-plus-keywords, and titles-plus-digests, was calculated, and these results are presented.."

        "content": "This paper continues the reporting of the Unit's work on a method of investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the shelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find.. The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they were looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status, and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of failure for different groups of volumes.. A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library.. The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. These differences were reflected in the results obtained.. It is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own libraries.."

A simplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectives are defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meet the needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in any service organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the explicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept may be) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first step to determining policy.  Since a complete state-of-the-art in user behaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted to drawing together some threads of research of potential application in university libraries.  Methodological problems are not discussed here, since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere."

We could define the latter without reference to the usual distinction between 'scientific literature' (the object of document analysis in information science) and other kinds of texts - historical records, myths, folklore, sacred writings, etc.).. Indeed, one of my theses in that there is little hope of understanding the kind of intellectual operations involved in the analysis of scientific documents, or questions pertaining to them other than through a study of textual analysis in general, as carried out in many disciplines - history, sociology, cultural anthropology, exegesis. etc. (Gardin, 1969)..

        "content": "A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968.. Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision.. A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made to identify reasons for failure.."

As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research.."

From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations, and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed.. Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff, than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods, or computer programming.. The total operating budgets of most of the systems have also been analysed to show the overall pattern of cost distribution, including overheads.."

This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not familiar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance of some of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how a machine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derived from a study of natural language, developed out of research into principles for a new general classification. PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings. Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index, PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature. Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the semantic sides of the system."

Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD Documentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meet these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems, and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this form for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But- Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only."

There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation figures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small.. It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on libraries.."

This leads to problems of: (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries.. (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects.. (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it fits as logically into one discipline as another.. Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears.. The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental relationships between concepts.. Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and Attributes as its vocabulary.."

It is suggested that these techniques are applicable to libraries and librarians and will become increasingly useful as the problems of increased work loads become more severe.. Data concerning standard times and performances would be useful for system design and planning, providing such data is put in its proper context and particularly if it is used to improve effectiveness as well as efficiency.."

Management information in a library is of greatest use in comparison, either internally, or with data from other libraries.. A simple, standard method of recording and costing is urged, so that librarians may readily identify procedures requiring improvement.. Development of the present costing method is traced from its original state as a simple management information system based on exception reporting (i.e. reporting the exceptions which occur in any particular survey), through a pilot study in a large university library, to its full installation in two further university libraries.. The method of analyzing the raw data is described, and examples of the tables are given, together with brief background information on the libraries concerned.. After a note on the limitations of the present costing method and of unit costs in general, unit times and costs are given for numerous operations in both the libraries surveyed, covering both reader and technical services.. There is agreement between results of several American studies and those of the present investigation.. For further comparison, the information on times and salaries has been used in conjunction with a standard civil service costing procedure.."

A comparison of university structure and university library structure shows how the system can bring about organizational strains and conflict situations in respect of career patterns of senior staff members.  The need to recognize academic considerations for library promotions is stressed and a case made out for the fullest involvement of all senior library staff in policy-making."

The principal service offered was a manual current awareness service, based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals. The service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for each reference notified, and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The relevance performance was good, and few references had been seen before; some precision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall.  The whole service was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high priority among the various possible claims on university resources.  Those who had the closest contact with the information officers had the best scores on most aspects evaluated and rated the service most highly.  Some general observations on the place and value of an information service in a university library are given in conclusion."

The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value and a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically justifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and periodical titles)..

This first working paper is a statement of: 1) the obstacles that presently exist which prevent the effective international interchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form; 2) the score of concern for the IFLA Working Group; and 3) the definition of terms included in the broader term \"content designators\"..

The chapter on \"Library and Information Networks\" in volume seven of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology provides a \"normative list\" of \"essential characteristics\": 1. A network's function is to marshal resources ... to accomplish results beyond the ability of any one of its members. 2. A network has developed an organizational design and structure that allows it to establish an identifiable domain.... 3. It has a base in communications technology."

        "content": "This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior.."

The basic purpose of this research is curriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip the middle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confronting them.  Although it would be possible to restructure the master's program and add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternative has not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculum is widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the new courses are designed for a different group of students - experienced librarians."

The development of modern science has brought about two principal changes in the situation: First it is no longer enough to simply provide for the retrieval of complete bibliographic items as a unit, but rather one tends more and more to request informational details that may be contained in the book. Second, modern knowledge has become too complex and interdependent that it is no longer possible to provide a single well-defined category for the books or journal articles."

Do you know that Los Angeles County, California, not only has the largest county law library collection in the United States, but it also has seven branch law libraries? These four questions readily point out the simple fact that the growth and development of county law libraries in the United States has been uneven, without pattern or standards, not only on a State-to-State basis, but on a county- to-county basis within a particular state.   A survey of the 39 state statutes relating to county law libraries reveals that there are no two states that have exactly the same method for the establishment, administration, financial support, or maintenance of a county law library."

Establishment of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of authorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American Cataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials.. Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished, that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship, including compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of corporate and personal authorship.."

As research and discovery are recorded in the journal literature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is its subscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomes a major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of experimental data available to their readers.  When funds are limited, the selection of a periodical collection that will best serve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramount importance.  A plan of highly selective purchasing must be adopted to prevent the improper use of funds.  Actual needs of the library must be at hand to carry out such a plan."

If one ignored the major historical resources in other languages (which few United States students read), notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and others (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental needs.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's A History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues as announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is very limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore, the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the development of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has been to tie it all together. In the present offering, \"the West\" is used conventionally: European civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere progeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to \"cover\" even the West may prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet an understanding of those lands \"beyond\" would be most valuable to us all. Let us hope that someone will try to provide it."

        "author": "Heiliger, E.M.",
        "content": "The goal of this book, Library Automation: Experience, Methodology, and Technology of the Library as an Information System, is to provide a perspective of the library functions that have been or might be mechanized or automated, an outline of the methodology of the systems approach, an overview of the technology available to the library, and a projection of the prospects for library automation. There is a concern in every library for the proper handling and control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and convenient fulfillment of service demands.  That concern is matched by excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers and communications network in many library functions.  Knowledge, the library's stock-in-trade, is being generated at an unprecedented rate and sought after with unprecedented intensity.  Technology, the driving force behind the library's problems and one hope for future solution, is being advanced to unprecedented levels."

Library automation systems, in the context of this work, are combinations of electronic data processing machines and appropriate programs and operating procedures, organized to work together in carrying out, with a minimum of human intervention, some well-defined library process.  It is a field that many thoughtful observers feel has reached a certain maturity, and so deserves to have its portrait made."

Taking under consideration the study of \"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries\" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications.  There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them.  These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings.  The working group succeeded in its task and brought forth its provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard edition was published earlier this year.  The success of this standard is manifested by the continuing increase in the number of countries that have adopted it."

In keeping with this idea, the Graduate School of Library Science of the University of Illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitious for holding an International Conference on Education for Librarianship. The profession as a whole and library education in particular are still quite young, but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionary changes.  Demands have been made on the world's libraries, and in turn on the schools' training personnel for these libraries, almost too rapidly for them to satisfy.  It seemed logical for library education, therefore, \"to measure the need and nature of future change and to evolve ideas that may influence its direction.\""

It happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader, or that in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book which he finds in the catalogue of another library, but which does not belong to his own collection. The book, very likely, is one that can be replaced if lost.  But it would take time to get it through ordinary channels; it might be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one, if the book is scarce.  In such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to borrow a book for a few days."

A hearty reception by a sympathizing friend, and the recognition of some one at hand who will listen to inquiries, even although he may consider them unimportant,  make it easy for such persons to ask questions, and put them at once on a  home footing."

        "author": "Elrod, J.M.",
        "content": "As early as 1905 the divided catalog was being presented as a preferable alternative to the dictionary catalog. Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser found that the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938.  She reported 21 articles based on actual experience with the divided catalog.  A quick check of her list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles. She recorded nine opponents of the divided  catalog and six better known members of the profession reserving judgement.  Lyle in his new edition of The Administration of the College Library considers it \"safer,\" rather than \"wiser\" as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing of subject and title entries.  The following questions were asked of all users of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks: 1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject? Were you looking under author, title, or subject? 2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog? 3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file? One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a separate catalog, 5 per  cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog."

Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last decade.  Possibly  because the number of public, college, university, and special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968 (Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969).

        "content": "The American urban public library is in something of a dilemma. Relatively secure in the affections of the populace, the library is nevertheless frequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and are associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably obscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were preposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find that tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12 years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think the experience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive. Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic success. The paradox invites some critical self-analysis."

The kindest and most conservative estimate I am able to bring myself to make is that there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this country as we can afford or are necessary. Perhaps the most constructive single thing that could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three publishers of a library periodical to cease publication. One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so much public wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chief advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print.  Instead we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed procreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and technology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of little consequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organization within the loose boundaries of our  profession, decides, virtually at the moment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of its own - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its presence to the world at large."

        "content": "A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains for current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately, the picture many faculty members have of what today's requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates are thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we fail even to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past and train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public libraries.   Library education, like the public library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of oblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will wither away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is no shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both. An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called \"Dust Gathers on the Public Library\" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is dead - while the public library lives on)."

Time's passage has replaced the monarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost has attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs may stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the profession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost accounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis. In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate requirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the six steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future."

In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced men and women.  One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology."

        "content": "The combination of computers and communications technology is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S. And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more effective ways. It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library's function is to parcel out information, and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed. In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts, state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely copied by the others."

Since there is an inseparable need not only for improved library statistical data systems but also for the above-mentioned frameworks for rational planning and decision making, we have devoted considerable effort to the development of analytical models that might assist library administrators in making decisions that would maximize the flow of benefits imparted to the communities the library serves.  Some of the results of this model-building effort are repored in these pages."

        "author": "Bloomquist, H.",
        "content": "According to a National Hospital Panel Survey conducted by the American Hospital Association in February 1970, 4,191 (72 percent) of the 5,820 community hospitals in the United States operated a library.  This percentage falls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100-bed capacity are considered (1,990 libraries in 3,318 hospitals).  In the 4,191 libraries, one or more full-time staff members were found in only 1,054 (25 percent).  In even fewer, 928, was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian. Clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform properly their functions of health education and patient care. By \"community hospital\" we mean the nonfederal, short-term hospital providing general and selected special services, the hospital located at some distance from a large medical center and without teaching and research programs, such as a nursing school or internships.  Though the librarians of more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study of this book, it is written primarily for an audience of untrained, probably newly employed, individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital's library and do not know where to begin."

        "content": "A wise German librarian has linked the library administrator and the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy in work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library's resources.  This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of cooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards. It is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectives setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be destroyed than are created. This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled \"Tasks for the future.\"  There was a time, and not so very far back, when the library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.  In the more immediate past, however, the two have become separated, so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down as a task for the future, the immediate future at that. Many new problems of administration have served to busy the administrator, and most catalogers have had more work than enough, with the result that administrators have come to know less and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know less and less about general library administration.  The situation now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem field."

        "content": "In spite of the great volume of material dealing with departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in library periodicals and books on university and college library administration, there has been relatively little original thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to provide an adequate background for solution of problems which have their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literature has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against this type of library organization or statements of how this or that institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except for contemporary accounts of early American scholars describing the attempts to transplant the German seminar library to American soil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is no account of the conditions which brought about and for many years invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation of trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last three-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators who are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, or amalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution."

Librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!"

        "author": "Goode, W.J.",
        "content": "An industrial society has an open class stratification system; it offers some an opportunity to rise, but it offers no guarantee against downward social mobility.  Compared to other types of societies, this one demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual in his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills of a high order. Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to rise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income."

Finally, we will deduce from these examples the performance and promise which special libraries may offer to a total library network or information system."

An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society.. An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information, and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are involved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of school-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages minority groups and governmental officials and staff.. Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same services, it is an uneconomic use of the communities' resources to maintain two separate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies.."

The role and control of the review article in medicine was described.. Over the past fifteen years, the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has been on the order of 1:38.. Possible solutions to a number of problems associated with the review literature are discussed, such as the selection of articles for review..Further examination of some critical questions relating to the production and organization of reviews will have to be undertaken before the review, as a means of bringing the most significant information to its users, will be accepted as a reliable adjunct to the original publications.."

Librarians and their assistants respect research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in helping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in most instances) of the usefulness of such research for the improvement of their own organizations. Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices; therefore, significant results can often be obtained with smaller samples and in shorter periods of observation.  People working in libraries do not feel they should curtail disclosures about basic processes.  Elsewhere professional employees are obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative committees.  At least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or more libraries almost always lie close at hand - there could hardly be any more convenient institution."

During that decade, the first controlled experiments on information retrieval were performed, and these mark a turning point in the history of classification research.  For the first time, experimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical importance to indexing and classification. It is my purpose here to review some aspects of the most notable of these experimental tests - the ASLIB Cranfield Research Project."

He questions its advocates' claim that it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began."

We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion."

Industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library.\tWeeding or storage requirements, therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study made by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals has potential for other libraries."

This is the beginning of an over-all automated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designed with the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from the University's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on the automated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr. Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  After the preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies were made.  Current (i.e., 1964) volume and costs were compared with anticipated volume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems."

The receiving unit reconverts the electrical impulse into an exact duplicate of the original document on a screen or in the form of a hard copy."

Participating states were Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.  This overlap data was needed to predict the degree of joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of collective reclassification. The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections, showing, for example, that a random title from one library had a 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library. When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%. Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest duplication elsewhere."

The publicity that has attended this project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments.  There has to date been very little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50 percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report, and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS system.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall value cannot help but be colored by this connection."

As compared with other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and cataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little agreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an integral part of reference work because many reference librarians are responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books and libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The preparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus \"reference librarian\" does, how can one readily determine the effectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a problem, but it is undeniably a big one."

This is in part because the secondary sources in the natural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessible data; in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the least restricted by linguistic barriers; and in part because the proposed world- wide systems, such as those advocated in the UNISIST report, offer an immediate field of application in the design of economic and efficient systems based on the results of numerical bibliographic analysis.  However, the field of possible application is gradually widening: serious efforts are now being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the social sciences, for example."

        "content": "The evaluation of reference service has received considerable attention in the literature over a comparatively long period.  But, as Samuel Rothstein pointed out in his 1964 Library Trends article on the measurement and evaluation of reference service, much of the literature has focused on discussing the lack of evaluation or the shortcomings of the evaluation that has taken place.  In the ten years since Rothstein wrote his article, there does seem to be more effort at evaluation of reference service.  Undoubtedly, many of the trends in recent evaluation are due to the influence of Rothstein's article."

One was the national sample survey of library use made for the Inquiry by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan.  Personal interviews of a half-hour or more in length were held with 1,151 people selected at random in different counties scattered over the United States. The sample was designed so as to represent all adult persons living in private households. By this tested method the survey gathered information concerning the amount and the kind of use people make of the public library and what changes or extension of library service people in general would prefer.  The survey also gathered information on the use of books obtained from sources other than the public library, as well as the extent of regular use of newspapers, radio, magazines, and movies."

The thought behind such a concept is to provide a separation of the more frequently used volumes from those that are infrequently used.  There have been, however, difficulties in determining what volumes are to be included within the core collection.  It is usually necessary to establish a committee or group of professional people who determine, usually by enumeration, those volumes that should be included in the core collection. Often the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions of the individuals, and although valid in many cases as desirable reading, the core collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements."

        "content": "The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries, apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposed by the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, which in university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was not considered to be of comparable importance with the major department -- the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions would be concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or official documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staff were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in answering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections, especially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with the general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-day reference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to become expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part in the activities of another.. Divisions between the various kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library's organization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that this is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach. Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freeze the administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject field often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his field, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection with his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer, orientalist or linguist. The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete re-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond the bounds of the old departments."

That is, these two, and only these two, commonly collect over a very broad spectrum, and in depth, material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge. Herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it be granted, as it is here assumed, that almost no field of human endeavor can advance without resort to the recorded past.  It is this twin aspect of the activity of these scholarly libraries - collecting simultaneously in breadth and in depth - which produces most of their major problems.  The concern of this paper is with two of these problems which seem by far the most important and difficult: the selection of materials and the utilization of subject specialists."

Production of monographs and journals, research reports and government documents has been increasing exponentially to the point that British university librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of space which their American counterparts have been struggling with for a number of years (judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in American library journals).  The force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat mitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds available for book purchasing, and by the increasing price of books.  However, when space in the library does become filled, obviously something must be done to create more space, because the flow of material is certainly not going to cease."

Although professionally my concern is with the history of science, I have a certain prehistoric past as a physicist, and this has led me to treat these lectures in what is, perhaps, an extraordinary way. My goal is not discussion of the content of science or even a humanistic analysis of its relations.  Rather, I want to clarify these more usual approaches by treating separately all the scientific analyses that may be made of science.  Why should we not turn the tools of science on science itself?  Why not measure and generalize, make hypotheses, and derive conclusions?"

The orientation is toward a formal definition of behavioral elements in an individual's \"purposeful state\": specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each course of action. The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action. The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the amount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message.  The amount of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies of the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in terms of the values of the objectives.\tThe amounts of instruction and motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message. The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of the amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount of motivation in the state.  This concept can be generalized to express the value of the state to some other individual."

To overcome these assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a management information system should be imbedded in a management control system. A procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is given of the type of control system which it produces."

        "content": "Several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysis of the R and D project selection decision problem.  This research indicates that these models do not meet with important practical requirements.  For example, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive index, in order to generate a wide range of project scores.  The additive index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index. The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on resulting project scores.  Comparative analyses relating project rankings produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development of the model.  Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of project data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or categories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications for final project scores and associated rankings."

MARC accelerated standardization and still more important, the standards are being set and agreed to be a large segment of the library community.

Superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of classificatory systems:  biological taxonomy, ecology, psychology, linguistics, archaeology, sociology, etc.  But more detailed examination shows that the kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based differ widely from science to science.  Whilst we recognize that some of the methods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are more widely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biological taxonomy.  The emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under which their application is valid, so that anyone who wishes to apply the methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations, and of the lines along which they may profitably be developed and modified."

During the past six or seven years, a group of us at the University of Illinois has been concentrating on the development of an objective measure of meaning, and this book is largely a progress report of that research."

        "author": "Smith, P.C.",
        "content": "The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategy for the Study of Attitudes.  This strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and, particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction. Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies.  If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction."

        "author": "Beeler, M.G.",
        "content": "There is probably no measurement task which public servants face which is more difficult than that of measuring the quality of service.  It is as difficult to measure the quality of hospital service, or of schools, or of social welfare programs, as it is to determine the quality of library service.  It is equally as difficult to decide what actions to take in order to improve service. Legislators, urban and regional planners, consultants, boards of trustees, accrediting teams, librarians, and a host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some conclusions about the quality of service offered by library systems.  This handbook is intended for these groups, and especially for practicing librarians.  The pervasiveness of the problem across all public service institutions, however, leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to other groups."

The innovation is a medical one, a drug which physicians use in everyday practice; the setting is in the Midwestern United States in the 1950's.  This study gives a glimpse of one small part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its allied institutions. But more generally, the question of the spread of an innovation is of interest to all students of society.  Particularly in an age of change, and in our complex and massive society, an understanding of the way in which an innovation can spread - for better or worse! - constitutes important knowledge of man.  It is to aid in this understanding, as well as to describe the case at hand, that this report is written."

The reader interested in a complete chronicle of the Library's experience with MEDLARS is advised to combine the reading of this report with a re-reading of the original MEDLARS story.  Thus he will be able to develop a complete picture that answers the questions: (1) What did the Library set out to do? (2) What was actually accomplished? and (3) What changes were made in the original system design and why?"

Meanwhile, however, a closely similar treatment of the problem of how to buy library materials, long in process, suddenly shaped up and was published by ALA in November 1969.  This was Purchasing Library Materials in Public and School Libraries by Evelyn Hensel and Peter D. Veilette. A treatment of the acquisition process in college and university libraries was also taking shape at this time and became the January 1970 issue of Library Trends.  The acquisition problems of research libraries were likewise getting detailed examination in the two annual International Seminars on Approval and Gathering Plans in Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, sponsored by Western Michigan University in the fall of 1968 and the fall of 1969."

        "content": "An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli used to represent documents in information retrieval systems.  In effect, since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon the examination of one \"level of processing\" of the document (e.g., the citation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties of what constitutes \"relevance\".  However, prior to such an analysis, an even more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions of a document should be examined. An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs), functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents by motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled experimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate response products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph, last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be representative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and abstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that: 1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document; 2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs; 3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and 4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not substantive. Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous work with unmotivated subjects."

The survey was designated to discover the subject, date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the most frequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of references to biomedical publications. The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issues involved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand was less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests were for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biological literature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8 per cent) involved English language periodicals. Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literature were citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recent literature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primary sources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the most used indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents."

Other kinds of status-judges include teachers assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers), critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in sports.  Status-judges are integral to any system of social control through their evaluation of role-performance and their allocation of rewards for that performance.

It argues that such social variables as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain phage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Even though persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided to enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though some recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient to account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the competitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecular biology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position, adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and philosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which occur in scientific development."

As is well known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also, in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments, a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each of its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.  It is now possible to construct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions (of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly) is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.  Moreover, they are easier to construct."

This review of several thousand articles and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much disagreement and confusion in the field.

        "content": "Concurrently with the RECON Pilot Project, the RECON working Task Force undertook to consider certain basic questions of retrospect conversation that are of national scope. First, is it feasible to define a level or subset of the MARC format that would allow a library using the lower level to be part of a future national network? Second, is it possible to use machine-readable records from a variety of sources in a national bibliographic store as a way to reduce the conversion effort on the national level? Third, what are the problems of producing a National Union Catalog from machine-readable records? As these studies and the pilot project progressed, it also became apparent that there were many practical difficulties in carrying out a large-scale conversion project.  Therefore, it seemed essential to investigate alternative strategies for RECON that might yield broad benefits in a reasonable short time span."

Initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems relating to scientific and technical documents, their handling and the management of such documents.  Specific matters to be reported on will include, the current organizational and functional situation in the United States; the extent to which known  deficiencies are causing a reduction in the  potential for technical effectiveness in the United States scientific and technical community; the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for correction of these deficiencies; and one or more action plans which can be followed by governmental (especially including Congress) and non-governmental units. 2. Secondary attention will be given to development of programs which can be undertaken with Government support for identifying,  analyzing, and giving a structure to the total flow of scientific and technical information in the United States.\""

        "content": "One of the most fundamental problems in the field of information retrieval is that of determining the circumstances under which it might be necessary to introduce an information retrieval system as an aid to a given population of scientists.  It is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of the transmission and development of ideas within a population.  Specifically, the transmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were the transmission of an infectious disease, that is, in terms of an epidemic process. An attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in the development of such a process."

        "author": "Goffman, W.",
        "content": "One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature of its own growth.  Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right. Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can therefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the given area. The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells.  In his recent comprehensive survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a \"full bibliography\" in which \"every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.\"  This bibliography constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of scientific ideas, since it provides us with  all the contributions to the subject area, from Ehrlich's discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963."

        "content": "Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very little experimental evidence on the consistency of either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor is reasonably constant.  But the position of the Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M. Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant. There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no mention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations to that article.  Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again, each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of which he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers."

        "author": "Fisher, H.L.",
        "content": "Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we used the generalized file-management system, Master Control, which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode. The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found.  (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases. We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched.  Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA. We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis.  The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered \"false drops,\" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation."

General rules are given for lexicographic processing of the keywords accumulated and for compiling of the descriptor vocabulary.. The algorithm has been constructed which is designed to generate the article of each descriptor in the thesaurus.. To construct this algorithm the author analyzed the results of word-association tests and selected 5 most important types of paradigmatic relations.. He formulates the basic rules for translation of the texts describing the main subject content of the documents and of the users' requests from a natural language into the IR language of descriptors..

The former condition is provided for by a matrix notation of document search patterns and requests, while the latter condition is met with the help of the transformational devices of the language.. Examples of search requests and patterns are considered, which illustrate the \"resolution\" of the grammatical and transformational devices being developed.. These are said largely to eliminate subjectiveness in assigning relational factors in search patterns and requests.. The relevancy criterion is formulated.. A retrieval algorithm based on this criterion has been compiled.. Experimental searches were conducted on a Minsk-22 computer.. The results were analyzed to evaluate the grammatical and transformational devices and to verify indexing principles devised for the automated retrieval system under development.. Factors of \"silence\" are discussed, as well as the contribution of the grammatical and transformational devices to reducing noise and enhancing recall.."

        "content": "The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical document collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords.. The indexing procedure includes:  analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document.. Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given.. Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for document and request indexing.."

Automatic derivative indexing is exemplified by key-word-in-context (KWIC) and other word- in-context techniques.  Advantages, disadvantages, and possibilities for modification and improvement are discussed. Experiments in automatic assignment indexing are summarized. Related research efforts in such areas as automatic classification and categorization, computer use of thesauri, statistical association techniques, and linguistic data processing are described.  A major question is that of evaluation, particularly in view of evidence of human inter-indexer inconsistency.

Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited more than 40 community hospitals indicate that medical-library facilities are generally poor and infrequently used by physicians.  The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist. Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library. Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.  The specialists, chosen from regions throughout the country, were requested to recommend two textbooks and two journals in their area of special interest that they considered to be the most basic and fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It was also requested that recommendations be made in order of preference."

Economic life was not meant to be that easy.  And perhaps some sensed what I here urge, that what was called success was less what served the individual than what served the goals of great industrial and military bureaucracies which had come, the economic myth notwithstanding, to comprise so large a part of the economic system.

Central to the study rationale was the notion that librarianship should be viewed not as a static institution committed solely to traditional objectives, but as one with the capacity to be responsive to changing environmental requirements. It was hoped that from the intelligence gathered from these inquiries certain of the significant dimensions of the field's manpower concerns would be illuminated and proposals to influence future development would be drawn.  Thus, while the investigations were in the nature of more basic research, their ends were committedly pragmatic."

Because of its school library orientation, this book distinguishes between essential and optional elements on the catalogue card. Libraries which require detailed cataloguing will consistently list these options, and may wish to augment the description of materials in the collation and in the notes.  Items necessary for a minimum description and for a complete description will be subject to further study prior to the next edition of this work."

To provide optimum access it is essential to be able to retrieve information in whatever physical format it is found.  Such retrieval requires the development of cataloguing codes that will handle all media, including diverse kinds of audio and visual materials. To be most effective these cataloguing guidelines should be acceptable on an international level and should have the support of professional organizations most concerned with these problems."

An analysis of published results of experiments testing the performance of roles and links in 176 descriptor retrieval systems operative in the USA suggests the conclusion about a poor performance of roles as a precision device:  an increase of 10 percent in precision with the aid of roles is accompanied by a 10 percent reduction of recall.. Links provide for approximately the same increase of precision..

In this setting, managerial decision making in the library has become an unenviably difficult task. Furthermore, the new technologies and new techniques which offer great opportunities for library planners and  managers make even more difficult the use of traditional, intuitive approaches.

The United States Steel Corporation is a formal organization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New York State Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part of a larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposes we need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn around an organization or the exact distinction between an \"organization\" and a \"nonorganization.\"  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the world has an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean classifications. Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged. We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However much organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and administrators, and however many books for these practitioners have been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant place in modern social science.  Most current psychology and sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the subject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology (Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, \"industrial social psychology\" (with only passing references to organizations), leadership, and voting behavior.  There is no comparable chapter on formal organizations, and only scattered reference to them throughout the text."

We lack the systematic evidence that eventually must come, but there are illustrative studies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time- nor space-bound. I assume that there are differences among organizations, and hope to account for some of them.  But I also assume that there is not a one- to-one correspondence between significant organizational differences and the typical categories of business, government, medicine, and education.

The fundamental notion of stability of an epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived.. A mechanism, called an information retrieval process, which instigates an epidemic process is defined, certain general properties of the mechanism are established and the means of controlling it are discussed.. Pontryagin's maximum principle is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the sense of Lyapunov.. This result makes it possible to determine the conditions for stability without knowledge of the solution of the differential equations which represent the process.."

The most prominent domain-independent theory is classification theory, the subject of Part I of this book.  Based on statistical decision theory, it provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they have been represented abstractly as vectors. Attempts to find domain-independent procedures for constructing these vector representations have not yielded generally useful results.  Instead, every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to its special characteristics.  Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domain has received by far the most attention.  Furthermore, work in this area has progressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description. Part II of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topics in visual scene analysis."

Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to be done than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies that could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed utilization of existing manpower. It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then president of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee on Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing professional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few libraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers that they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a need was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could be more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might have national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be sought."

This is a book about the planning process, not the details of all parts of a building.

Our fundamental concern, however, was to discover whether the cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology.  The men who have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent about psychology - the creatures whose behavior they want to simulate often seem more like a mathematician's dream than like living animals.  But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or even an advantage.  There must be some way to phrase the new ideas so that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior that psychologists have created.  It was the search for that favorable intersection that directed the course of our year-long debate."

        "author": "Austin, D.",
        "content": "In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new technique of chain indexing to British libraries.  Twenty years later, with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first issues of 1971. To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example. In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified by the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical file.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal of Cutter's \"Rules for a dictionary catalog\" is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of natural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselected component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings would be co-extensive with the subject of the document."

        "content": "Since the first edition of Library of Congress subject headings appeared 60 years ago, American and other libraries have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority -- if not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There can be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a labor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its value as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic. Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to ordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as Washington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarship are, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally, manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the worldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realm of headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with humanity--the LC list can only \"satisfy\" parochial, jingoistic Europeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally Christian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably situated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely domiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established Order, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of Western civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed, obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to young people and women.  And exudes something less than sympathy or even fairness toward organized labor and the sexually unorthodox or \"avant-garde.\""

An analysis of \"knowledge,\" on the other hand, seems to be the philosopher's task, though some aspects of it are claimed by the sociologist.  But if one speaks of the \"communication of knowledge in the United States,\" the specialist in education may feel that this is in his bailiwick; also the mathematician or operations researcher specializing in communication theory and information systems may prick up his ears.  In fact, some of the knowledge to be discussed here is technological, and thus the engineer may properly be interested.  When I tried out the title of this study on representatives of various disciplines, many were rather surprised that an economist would find himself qualified to undertake this kind of research."

Over the past two years various means have been evaluated of converting the library's card catalogues (which were closed at the end of 1971) to a more compact form.. An interim report mentioned microfilming as one of a number of possibilities.. At the time the production of hard copy was envisaged, but since then a true microform system has seemed preferable, in which the catalogue would exist as cassettes of film to be viewed by all users on reader machines.. This system has been specified and costed, and details are included in this paper.. The impetus in reaching this viewpoint was provided by the progress made over the last 18 months in the field of COM, which rapidly commended itself as the choice of output medium for the new mechanized MARC-based catalogue, which covers all the library's serials and all monographs acquired after January 1972.. BLCMP union catalogues in these categories will also be held in COM form at Birmingham University Library.."

The programs allowed both weighted and Boolean searching on the title and author, LC classification and subject headings, and the BNB Precis indexing terms and Reference Index Numbers.. Test profiles were constructed for nine libraries covering a range of subject fields, and run on six weeks of BNB and six weeks of LC MARC tapes.. The output was assessed for relevance and recall, and the results analyzed in terms of precision and recall for various combinations of searchable fields.. The best performance, with recall and precision both about 50%, was given by searching all verbal fields together - title and author, LC subject headings, and (BNB tapes only) Precis indexing terms.. Costs for the experimental on-line system, and a batch version of the system, are identified.."

An International Conference of Libraries and Documentation Centres was held in Brussels from 11 to 18 September 1955.  During the Conference, a whole forenoon was devoted to a Group Meeting on \"Classification, General and Special\", under my Chairmanship.  The following two resolutions recommended by the Group Meeting were adopted by the Plenary Meeting on 16 September 1955. \"1 The FID recommends that a deeper and more extensive study should be made of the general theory of classification, including facet analysis, and also of their application in the documentation of specific subjects. \"2 The Commission proposes, that in liaison with the FID/CA Committee, a permanent Working Group be created in order to make mutual exchange of theoreticians' experiences and points of view possible.  The rapporteurs shall bring about the creation of such a group and furnish the information and means of work in order that practical results may be obtained in the shortest time, by making mail exchanges easier and more frequent.  The scheme proposed by Dr. Ranganathan will serve as the basic document\" [154].  Further, at its meeting held on 16 September 1955, the Council of FID requested its Bureau to convene an International Seminar on Classification. This was in accord with the memorandum prepared by me at the request of Donker Duyvis [133]."

Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related.. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis..

The plan for the book originated with questions directed to a public library administrator and to a system director.  The most pertinent of the repeated questions was, \"How does system membership change local library administration?\"  The sharpest question was, \"Will the system ultimately take over local rights and responsibilities?\""

Too often librarians have had only a few courses in mathematics, and some actually have a psychological antipathy toward numbers.

All too many librarians regard government documents and in particular, the documents of international agencies as esoteric, unlike the usual library materials in format and publication pattern, and as presenting problems of acquisitions, control and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left to the specialist in documents.  The result is that international documents are a puzzlement to the general librarian, and a source of frustration to the ill informed administrator; a situation exacerbated by the present general tendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international documents except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of a general course in government documents to which relatively few students are exposed.  The information in this volume will allay the fears of the generalist librarian.  It also provides the data on which to base additional emphasis on international documents in the library school curriculum."

This is not a book, to state the proposition in the negative, for those who wish to read on the theoretical aspects of computers. The selections are brought together in seven sections.  The first, the Challenge, includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age of the computer. The second section, Varieties of Response, does not by any means exhaust developments in American libraries.  It does, I believe, contain representative descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished. The third section, Theory of Management, contains an outstanding article by Richard DeGennaro of Harvard.  The particular contributions made in this article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this third section. News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of selection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer. The considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the first selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific services now being offered, or services in the planning stage. The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a subject that has elicited considerable discussion.  The two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative costs. The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of view.  The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings. The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has excited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject indexing could in time prove considerable."

If it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation, it is so no longer.  One must conceive of them as part of a medical system, and indeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine as practiced by a single physician for a single patient.  It extends into the health sciences as represented by dentists, pharmacists, nurses, veterinarians, medical technologists, medical associates and dozens of others, some not yet possessing a clear identity.  It includes research, education and practice.  In addition to the clinical sciences, the system involves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health.

Viewed in this way, and perhaps as antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical matters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with the rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual inquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and the scholar. Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which clearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically not only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys which derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit for the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative capacity, who have not before held this perspective of research."

The first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a perforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the card.. After the data is edited and corrected, it is processed by a computer to form (1) catalog card typesetting tapes, (2) the National Union Catalog, (3) Library of Congress Books, Subjects Catalog, magnetic tape catalog files, and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution.. The procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on Library of Congress cards, should studies find that the value of the data exceeds the cost of recording it.. A demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce perforated tape records..

While it has long been recognised that only a proportion of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with remarkable speed.  In certain cases some new buildings are full even before they have left the design-board stage.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that 'in terms of long range perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is no feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous programme of \"selective book retirement\"'.  Library stock control has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy, time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems of acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services for readers.  Early investigations of this issue have tended to be theoretical and Carol Seymour in her review \"Weeding the Collection\" put forward the view that \"a librarian should be able to begin his plan for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary... He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden\".  The Pebul Report summarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when it observed that \"weeding the bookstock\" in academic libraries was the \"ungrasped nettle.\""

A difficulty in this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely to yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonable limits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, and even so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has been placed on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this is considered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has not, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance, but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval of non-relevant references.

The growth of the literature is considered quantitatively with respect to the form, subject and origin of published material.. This is related to the general growth in scientific activity as exemplified by increases in numbers of physicists and of expenditure on research.. The results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the needs or demands of users of the physics literature are considered, particularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of information transfer, and the reactions of users to new services intended to remedy the deficiencies.. Finally, a number of recently established services - some designed to meet hitherto unsatisfied needs - are described.. The role of the computer in the development of local, national and international documentation systems is examined.."

The two aspects of a structural notation most determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform use of general categories (the latter, not merely for the sake of uniformity as such, but as the means to a heightened flexibility).  These desiderata could of course be present on the \"idea plane\" alone; but without their being present notationally they do not furnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the type of assistance it requires for optimal functioning. The second (minor) premise ought to be that the Universal Decimal Classification, being both hierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desired structurality.  But the melancholy fact is that this desideratum is not always satisfied, for instance when UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy when division by general category would be equally appropriate."

It thus comparizes simple and \"fused\" (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused), or annelated, systems (including spiro forms),  but not systems like biphenyl or triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms not belonging to the rings.  Some systems are included in which a polar valence is involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shown in formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bond is noted.  Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelate compounds).  The word \"system\" is used to mean a single ring or a combination of rings united one to another by atoms common to both. Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compounds of generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have a certain structure, are included.  The fact that a compound must have one or two alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on either of them.  Where there is doubt about an entry a query (?) is inserted after the reference."

There is an urgency associated with this rededication, which grows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planning of anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologists have been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of international development programs.  A general theory of history is required if the expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other than the rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learned journals.  The publishing of more and more about less and less is an acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not lead to an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues."

Without pretending to exactness, we may divide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-title or bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the Boston Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the Boston Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, the catalog now making by the Library of Congress.  To avoid the constant repetition of such phrases as \"the full catalog of a large library\" and \"a concise finding-list,\" I shall use the three words Short, Medium, and Full as proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short family are not all the same size, that there is more than one Medium, and that Full may be Fuller and Fullest.  Short, if single-columned, is generally a title-a-liner; if printed in double columns, it allows the title occasionally to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium does not limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds four lines, and gets many titles into a single line.  Full usually fills three or four lines and often takes six or seven for a title."

Kuhn.  Kuhn has not been accepted without criticism, but that need not prevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion.  I assume that the reader will be familiar with Kuhn's analysis,so that only a sketchy summary of his position is necessary.  I will then take a brief look at some of the history of psychology, with special emphasis upon the major tenets of behaviorism.  Finally, I will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well be living in an era of revolution within psychology (as well as without)."

The thesis which Palermo advocated is that Kuhn's view of scientific revolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology, and that, in particular, experimental psychology has had two paradigms already, with the appropriate scientific revolution between them, and that the current behavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of Kuhnian crisis.  The present note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo's assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a standard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first, challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a Kuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorism is in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons for this."

        "content": "Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about trends in science.  For example, there has been a continuing interest in the question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its age.  These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the major branches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interested in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future. Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to push these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject division, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical properties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect of such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline. We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a statistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the appearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its first appearance can such an area be identified?"

We now report the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature. The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they present, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we have systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation, and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects of the specialty structure of science."

On the other hand, many of the large universities have shifted the emphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study. Still others have tried to develop both side by side. Few of the small colleges have kept astride with the inevitable consequences of such a situation.  The few who have are sending an increasing number of their graduates to these universities to complete their training.  As an example of this, it is the boast of Pomona College that over seventy per cent of her graduates have taken subsequent professional training. It has become the evident duty, therefore, of the small college to prepare its men, not only to enter such graduate schools, but also to meet successfully the ever-increasing intensity of competition found there.  This in addition to supplying a broad cultural education.  This duty has brought with it a number of problems of first magnitude.  One of the biggest of these is the problem of adequate library facilities. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss this problem with special reference to the student whose college major is chemistry."

        "content": "In this paper I propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers.  It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of antecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they could be located quickly.  The citation index makes this check practicable. Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing the citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort required to compile it. This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a new approach to subject control of the literature of science.  By virtue of its different construction, it tends to bring together material that would never be collated by the usual subject indexing.  It is best described as an association-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway as he requires.  Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject heading."

Deviations from the exponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If the total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from the curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles grows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations from an exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two \"pauses\" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel to the theoretical curve.  The well-known hypothesis of exponential growth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less than half that found by Price and other investigators.\tThe discrepancy appears to be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account the titles published before the beginnings of the time series used."

Gradually the study began to incorporate calculations of the effects of variable growth on a wide range of scientific concerns: studying, teaching, research, publishing, citations, the basis of scientific prestige, promotions, unemployment.  It became apparent that generally unsuspected forces have a powerful influence on the careers of scientists and everyone else enmeshed in rapid change. This book presents some evidence for change and speculates about many effects.  It also makes a beginning toward understanding the forces that cause and do not cause change.  It may provide some solace for those in dormant fields who have wondered why life has passed them by.  It may, perhaps, make a few highly successful scientists a little more modest.  Most of all it may guide those who still have a choice - and so have we all."

        "content": "A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory of information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or telegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively. From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations. Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics."

Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis.  It seems, if we judge by constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises and revolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novel self-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least among psychologists.  This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of psychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean Piaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been developing a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the development of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn acknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking."

I will first make some preliminary points about the word 'objective'. This will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming too rarefied.  Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third, I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach is seriously misleading.  I will propose a formula for systematically transforming Popper's theses and exposing what is important in them.  This 'transformative method' points the way towards an entirely different conception of what makes knowledge objective."

Unlike many previous expositions about the best environment for technical people, the findings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a wide range of research personnel. Work progressed over the next four years, and a number of intriguing results began to emerge.  But as these were discussed with other investigators studying different kinds of R & D laboratories, discrepancies appeared.  It became clear that a broader study was needed before one could be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for research personnel.  We set out to design a study in which standardized instruments would be administered to scientists and engineers in several types of laboratories."

This parochial tendency has left students and researchers with the often bewildering and always time- consuming problem of learning new procedures for processing their data each time they change institutions (or each time the institution changes computers)."

It used to be believed that the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous progressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War and then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as easily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have been raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only means of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves, faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively for the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with the social and economic developments which are occurring around them.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to investigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a destructive utilization of science."

The first step into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of South and East Africa, including, from south to north, the species Papio ursinus, cynocephalus and anubis.  Their social organization and its ecological context have been subject to long range field work by HALL (1962 a, b) in South Africa, by DEVORE (1962) in Kenya, and by ALTMANN and ALTMANN (in preparation) in Kenya ad Tanzania.

Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social structures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand, furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, our effort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization of an open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations."

        "content": "During the past three hundred years the journal article has become the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication. Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).  Who published what and where therefore becomes a central question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular scientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number of investigations concerning the career of such publications.  This career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages. 1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulates it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971). 2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journals for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). 3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the published article or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  The practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline."

        "content": "In recent years social scientists have given increased attention to problems of inequality, justice, and discrimination in American society. The influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individuals is being studied in an effort to estimate the \"fairness\" of social institutions in rewarding talent.  Social scientists are trying to determine the extent to which so-called \"irrelevant\" characteristics influence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions and eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income, prestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society, science has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Little is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This book examines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratification of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance, or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment? A more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether universalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for recognition in the social system of science."

I have tried to indicate its possible broader relevance by pointing out certain basic parallels between the \"social system\" of science and other social systems within society.  I hope, further, that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions I have drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seems now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who are concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goals of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior. My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most individuals, most of the time, come to \"want\" to do what it is that society \"needs\" them to do.  Only when we can answer this question satisfactorily, can we develop a sociology capable of providing both prediction and meaning."

This chapter sets forth the concept of 'the influential,' identifies two distinctive types of influentials, the 'local' and the 'cosmopolitan,' and relates these types to the structure of influence in the local community. The second of these chapters, \"Contributions to the Theory of Reference Group Behavior,\" draws upon the ample evidence provided by The American Soldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselves to the norms of various groups, in particular the groups with which they are not affiliated. The other two chapters added to this edition have not been published before.  The first of these, \"Continuities in the Theory of Social Structure and Anomie,\" tries to consolidate recent empirical and theoretical analyses of the sources and consequences of that breakdown of social norms which is described as anomie.  The second, \"Continuities in the Theory of Reference Groups and Social Structure,\" tries to bring out some of the specially sociological, as distinct from the socio-psychological, implications of current inquiries into reference-group behavior.  The intent is to examine some of the theoretical problems of social structure which must be solved before certain further advances can be made in the sociological analysis of reference groups."

It is the means by which the individual scientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work to gain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain his knowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for the allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it is a means of exercising social control. The informal communication system, although important, is the distaff side.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory rewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by the social system through informal systems of communication, though it is growing in importance as an information dissemination system."

Research networks are seen to pass through three phases.. The first, exploratory phase is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems.. The second phase is one of rapid growth, associated with increasing social and intellectual integration, made possible by improved communication.. An increasingly precise scientific consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation, in which those participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence.. But as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically fruitful; and as the network grows, career opportunities diminish.. Consequently, the third, final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the network, together with the movement of participants to new areas of scientific opportunity.."

Those historians and philosophers of science who express this point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral part of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop a pyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists.. An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible for advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National Academy members of today, are the \"pedestrians\" of history.. This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the field of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawn from a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third from a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by various types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the research produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implications of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas for necessary future research are suggested.."

The analysis mostly uses multivariate linear regression.. Large and significant correlations with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, research production, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality of PhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six to nine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the variance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are held constant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly associated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates of inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differences in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied.. It is shown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientific communication and with departmental morale even after possible confounding variables are held constant.."

The task of this book is to place in the reader's hands a sort of chart and compass to use in finding his way around and learning how the system works. For each subject, the treatment falls into two parts.  First a specialist, sought out for his grasp of the literature, presents a bibliographical review of basic monographic works for a collection of substantive material. This review is followed by a list of reference works.  Informative annotations are provided for all works except those adequately explained by the title.  Specialized works are included, especially when they exemplify types of sources important for reference purposes.  First priority goes to works which may be looked upon as basic for a program of service to a general clientele made up of scholars, students and the public at large. If some stress falls on bibliographies, it is because they serve as controls for opening doorways to even vaster information and to sources that are more obscure."

The steps involved are the following:  definition of the purpose of the program, and financial and administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged by management; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed audience of the program; analysis and definition of program performance requirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing performance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of program design; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design. Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing, and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs in the design process."

The three current awareness publications are shown to have a relationship in terms of the number of requests they can produce from a given set of references or notices.  The SDI system will produce about one request from ten notices; the intermediate type about one request per hundred notices; ad the unselected type, one request per thousand notices.  Despite the differences in the number of notices to generate one request, the cost to produce one request is about the same for the three types of tools.  Also, the usage of these tools is related to the amount of user time available and a curve is presented based on various assumptions to define this relationship."

A survey which assessed the impact of the services on the information habits of the university users is also discussed.  Over 97% of the survey respondees indicated that the services had contributed to their professional activities.  Some users reported that the service had been a method of bypassing library reference works; others indicated that the service had brought them back into the  library and made them aware of information sources previously unknown to them."

Five areas which impact the center's interface with these two communities are discussed: the nature of the data bases which are available for search; retrieval results and factors which affect them; the timeliness of services; costs and prices; and practical operational considerations related to library interests.  Comparison shopping between centers is advised as centers differ considerably in the services which are offered,  the data bases which are available, the experience of the information specialists who construct search profiles, pricing structures which are used, and the prices which are charged. Implications of the growing trend toward licensing and leasing information resources, especially magnetic tape services, are discussed briefly."

The survey resulted in a 9.6% reduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additional shelf space in which to display journals.  Further studies of the accumulated data are being made to determine which holdings will be sent to a remote storage area which is under construction.  The survey data have been and will continue to be consulted before any journals are converted to microfilm."

The machine searches furnished a higher percentage of unrelated materials. However, little staff time is required to obtain them.

        "content": "The following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures delivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Reader in Bibliography, 1921. As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in library administration and bibliography. Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity in the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this a chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the activities of the human mind. My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical application to library work and the compilation of subject bibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered in relation to the growth of modern civilization. Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends with the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their final interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary qualifications.  I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors which are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.  On this count I offer no defense."

The mathematics with which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs, or more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurations called digraphs, which consist of \"points\" and \"directed lines.\"  When these terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematical models of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflect structural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematical terms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory has applicability to many different fields of investigation."

A fortunate involvement with an experimental college course treating physical science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success. Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly from scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing avocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow, whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history.  Except for a few articles, this essay is the first of my published works in which these early concerns are dominant.  In some part it is an attempt to explain to myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn from science to its history in the first place."

Thereby, in contrast to certain versions of Durkheim that teach that the objective reality of social facts is sociology's fundamental principle, the lesson is taken instead, and used as study policy, that the objective reality of social facts as an ongoing accomplishment of the concerted activities of daily life, with the ordinary, artful ways of that accomplishment being by members known, used, ad taken for granted, is, for members doing sociology, a fundamental phenomenon.  Because, and in the ways it is practical sociology's fundamental phenomenon, it is the prevailing topic for ethno-methodological study.  Ethnomethodological studies analyze everyday activities as members' methods for making those same activities visibly-rational- and-reportable-for-all-practical-purposes, i.e., \"accountable,\" as organizations of commonplace everyday activities.  The reflexivity of that phenomenon is a singular feature of practical actions, of practical circumstances, of common sense knowledge of social structures, and of practical sociological reasoning.  By permitting us to locate and examine their occurrence the reflexivity of that phenomenon establishes their study."

This is farther than ever - at least to all appearances - from the original intention of 1895 of the founders of the Institut International de Bibliographie (now known as the Federation Internationale de Documentation), i.e., the standardization of classification methods."

The basic requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and retrieved from, an ordered file. While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex terms or even single words, it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex. To express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined, or that only one part of the subject be shown. The former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the concept an entry should be made."

These changes coincided with the publication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showed clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same.  However, although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was no one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I felt was needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and its reception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill a real need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and - more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States, where British textbooks on classification had previously been regarded with something akin to suspicion.

The principal classed catalogs now remaining are those of the Engineering Societies Library in New York, the John Crerar Library in Chicago, and the Science and Technology Department of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  There are, nevertheless, many things to commend the classed catalog.  Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument between the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical catalog is concerned.  However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for one not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no approach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library's collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced."

In this book I have tried to cover the whole subject, starting with introductory material and leading to the more advanced topics, assuming a minimal technical background on the part of the reader.  I did not attempt to provide detailed techniques for the design of specific circuits, but rather to formulate methods and to develop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems.

It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to explore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established methods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed. Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects."

In all cases the citizen feels a perfect right to have his say about the way in which the managers manage. Not only has the citizen become far more vocal, but he has also in many instances begun to suspect that the people who make the major decisions that affect our lives don't know what they are doing.

The criticism usually relates to the recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact- finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  One can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on original research or the writing of proposals, which either are not adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  If the librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited interest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work there are no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusions into action."

Its basis is a body of survey data collected from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations and from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work.. While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational, and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the information was applied.. The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions, one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational objectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal sources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on \"professional\" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge.. In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have, within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the need for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in this process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formal and social groups.. Firms need to establish two-way communication about needs and  possibilities; by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the needs of society.."

        "author": "Studer, William Joseph",
        "content": "From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued.."

An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed.. Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulated in terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles of lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems.. Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are discussed.. In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method of solution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systems are considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along the characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages.. It is shown that solving for Green's function (and associated eigenvalue problem) is not required..

        "author": "Lister, Winston Charles",
        "content": "For the last several decades library collections have been growing at exponential rates with no relief evident in the future.. To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections, many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials.. Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared.. For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average geometric pattern of obsolescence.. The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon the circulation activities of the individual libraries.. An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored.. Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit relocation cost.. Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules.."

        "author": "O'Neill, Edward True",
        "content": "Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.."

        "content": "Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous problems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical of these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and advantages.. The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies.. By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the indexing method used.. It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied, one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the aforementioned file.. The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included as an appendix to this dissertation.."

As early as 1608, when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley's Library, \"he proposed the establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student.  But Sir Thomas Bodley was opposed.\"  So it is to Harvard that we turn for an example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate's plight. Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities and their libraries were relatively small until this century.  More important, they were largely undergraduate institutions.  The great expansion of graduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon.  The problems of the undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of materials suitable for research. The large university collections became increasingly difficult for the undergraduate to use.  When he had to select his books from the card catalog and obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might well abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out, missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes.  The university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - study conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the volume of work."

With the phonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from the operational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal encyclopedia.  Education by classified data has been the Western program ever since. Now, however, in the electronic age, data classification yields to pattern recognition, the key phrase at IBM.  When data moves instantly, classification is too fragmentary.  In order to cope with data at electric speed in typical situations of \"information overload,\" men resort to the study of configurations, like the sailor in Edgar Allan Poe's Maelstrom. \"The medium is the message\" means, in terms of the electronic age, that a totally new environment has been created.  The \"content\" of this new environment is the old mechanized environment of the industrial age."

However, Winograd's \"Program for Understanding Natural Language\" seems sufficiently general and important in its implications to warrant the experiment.  Some readers will find sufficient the first two sections, which present, respectively, an overview of the system and what it does, and a first-rate evaluation of research in artificial intelligence on natural language processing, semantics, and theorem proving. Others will want to explore in detail the structure of the syntactic component, the treatment of semantics, and the programming language for specifying theories of problem solving.  Each of these contributions is significant in its own right.  Together they form a unique, integrated system capable of parsing, interpreting, and acting upon the information contained in complex natural language discourse."

The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective countries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field of the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist..

Successive ages have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the control and exploitation of his intellectual property, the related interest of the publisher, and the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas.  It is this striking of balances in the law of copyright in the past, at present, and for the future, which constitutes the central theme of the James Carpentier Lectures delivered by Professor Benjamin Kaplan at the Columbia University School of Law in March, 1966."

Gradually, however, these pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social and even economic achievements of the international library community - which was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of national efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others overgenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception."

Toward the end of the conference, when it had become apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently explicitly formulated model, the question was raised:  What should we be teaching our students?  Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt: We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic problem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light - negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in general are like."

The long-term concern is the question of how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that can be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-term concern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing card catalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user requirements.

Weapons Acquisition is defined to include the conception, development, and production of technically advanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Process emphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weapons programs, including the actions, reactions, and interactions of government agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicates our concern with how these activities and relationships affect the quality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs. The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge of these facets of weapons development and production.  Such an objective classified the volume as a social science, rather than administrative study.  Yet most social science research, however \"pure\" the form, is ultimately directed at changing public policy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with a specific set of public policy recommendations.

The author's own research is reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  In addition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study. 2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their present collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain and justify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for \"weeding without tears.\" 3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal with the acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one of the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful collections. 4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped that libraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs of weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of circulation and in user satisfaction."

In part, this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators in the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used to study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparent theoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to be highly specific and inadequately defined.

This recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which the tendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities was greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiry into the soundness of the supposition."
